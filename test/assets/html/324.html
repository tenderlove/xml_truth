<P CLASS="author">By Anita Bohn</P>
<P>For Ruby K. Payne, founder and CEO of the  for-profit consulting and publishing company called aha! Process Inc. in  Highlands, Texas, poverty is big business. Since 1996, Payne and her assistants  have been conducting 200 seminars a year training as many as 25,000 teachers  and school administrators to work with children from poverty, making her the  single biggest influence on teachers' understanding of children from poverty in  the United States.
<P>I first heard  the name Ruby Payne from teachers and school administrators about eight years  ago when interviewing a school district about professional development  opportunities in multicultural education in their district. Several teachers  and an administrator told me Payne had been brought to town to conduct  workshops for the teachers and that the district had bought each participant a  copy of her book <I>A Framework for Understanding Poverty</I>.  Over the next few years I heard references like this over and over again, not  only in my home state of Illinois, but from teachers and administrators around  the country.
<P>Initially, I  had trouble finding out much about Payne's work, apart from these word-of-mouth  testimonials. My university library, a good one with substantial holdings, had  no books by Ruby Payne, nor did the consortium of university libraries to which  it belonged. When I typed the name "Ruby Payne" into a Google search, though, I  hit a jackpot of sorts: Google reported thousands of hits. School districts  across the nation and even in Australia and New Zealand announced upcoming aha!  Process workshops for teachers, or reported on workshops recently conducted in  their districts. 
<P>How had  someone so widely hailed in the public schools as an expert on poverty been  ignored by national research institutes, higher education, and all the major,  published authorities on the subject of poverty? It took several months of  investigating print and media sources on Payne, interviewing participants and  trainers of her workshops, and participating in two initial training sessions  before I finally was able to shed some light on the phenomenon called Ruby  Payne.
<H3>The Framework
</H3>
<P>Payne's principal message is that poverty is not  simply a monetary condition. She describes it to her audiences as a culture  with particular rules, values, and knowledge transmitted from one generation to  the next that inform people how to live their lives successfully &mdash; how to build  and keep relationships, how to get one's needs met, how to entertain and be  entertained, and more. Payne asserts that children growing up in a culture of  poverty do not succeed because they have been taught the "hidden rules of  poverty," but not the hidden rules of being middle class. 
<P>Likewise,  Payne claims, public school teachers who are predominately from the middle class  do not understand or relate to their students from poverty because they don't  appreciate the hidden and essential rules for survival in poverty. Payne sees  her educational mission as opening channels of communication, making explicit  the hidden rules of class at all levels, and encouraging teachers to teach  children of poverty the rules of middle class.
<P>In <I>A Framework  for Understanding Poverty</I>, Payne asks her readers, as she asks  her audiences, to take her "Could you survive?" quizzes. Here are a few examples  of what Payne considers the essential knowledge of the lower class: 
<UL>
	<LI>
		<P>I know how to get someone out of jail. </P>
	</LI>
	<LI>
		<P> I know how to physically fight and defend myself physically. </P>
	</LI>
	<LI>
		<P> I know how to get a gun, even if I have a police record. </P>
	</LI>
	<LI>
		<P>I know how to entertain a group of friends with my personality and my stories. </P>
	</LI>
</UL>
<P>A few hidden rules from the middle class are:
<UL>
	<LI>
		<P> I know how to hire a private attorney to handle a criminal or civil matter. </P>
	</LI>
	<LI>
		<P> I know how to reserve a table at a restaurant. </P>
	</LI>
	<LI>
		<P> I know how to set and decorate a table with  flowers, place mats, and napkins. </P>
	</LI>
	<LI>
		<P>I know how to evaluate and purchase  appropriate medical, life, disability, homeowners, auto, and personal  property insurance. </P>
	</LI>
</UL>
<P>On my first  read-through of the "rules" I didn't know whether to laugh at the sheer  stupidity of some of them or to rage at the offensive stereotyping of people in  poverty and the thinly veiled bigotry reflected in others. I am still hard  pressed to understand why ideas like this have made Payne the hottest speaker/trainer  on poverty on the public school circuit today. One thing is certain, though:  Ruby Payne has flown under the radar far too long. It's time for teachers and  administrators to take a critical look at her immensely popular message.
<H3>Troubling Features 
</H3>
<P>Payne and the company she owns, aha! Process Inc.,  self-publish her books. That means her research does not have to be verifiable,  reproducible, valid, or reliable in order to get published. Payne's promotional  materials talk about her valuable "case studies," but you quickly learn from  reading her books and attending her workshops that there is nothing more  substantive than a few random anecdotes about children and families she claims  to have encountered over the years. These anecdotes become even less credible  when they are parroted by one of her minions, who are available to present to  your group for somewhat lower rates than Payne herself. I attended one such  workshop led by an underling, and found the speaker's presentation sprinkled  with stories that generally began "Ruby talks about this one girl..." or "Ruby has this one family who...." Whatever this is, it is not  research. 
<P>Payne's books  and lectures present a superficial and insulting picture of children and  families in poverty. Poor people, according to Payne, are scofflaws perpetually  looking for a fight or some other good time when they are not busy milking the  system. The "case studies" that I personally heard referred to in her workshops  made her audiences laugh and cluck their tongues, and bordered on bigotry.  Payne's books primarily are sold to  those who hire her or one of her representatives to conduct seminars. That  turns out to be a requirement of Payne's contract when she signs up with a  school district: that they purchase one of her books for every participant &mdash; a  very convenient and lucrative arrangement. In fact, many of the books  themselves &mdash; especially the main <I>Framework</I> book &mdash; are  virtually useless without the accompanying seminar. They are more like  workbooks with the answers missing, or a collection of overhead transparencies  meant to be filled in with the speaker's remarks. 
<P>Payne  directly targets one of the largest, hungriest markets for quick fixes in  public education: the ubiquitous and mandated inservices organized and offered  in every school district in the nation. Payne charges real money for her  services &mdash; $300 per individual registrant on her public tours, and upwards of  $3000 for three-day contract workshops with school districts, plus the required  textbook purchases. Her secrets to working with children of poverty are making  her a very rich woman while the school districts that hire her are districts  with high poverty rates and in need of workable solutions.
<H3>Downright Dangerous Message 
</H3>
<P>The self-promoting nature of Payne's practices is not  really what makes her ideas so harmful, though. It's what teachers are learning  in the workshops that worries me. One teacher told me after an aha!Process  workshop that something she learned in Payne's seminar was "poor people can't  think abstractly." Consider the curricular decisions that might be made by a  teacher who takes away that understanding of her students from a Ruby Payne  workshop.
<P>Payne offers  teachers and administrators something very seductive: simple and comfortable  solutions to complex school problems. Payne's facile answers allow teachers and  administrators to place the blame for low-income children's lack of academic  success entirely outside the schools.
<P>The real  danger of Payne's ideology is that it effectively prevents social change. It  makes us believe that we can reduce the problem of poverty without needing to  make any changes in society or in our own lives. We just need to teach them a  different set of rules to live by. As every social scientist knows, social  beliefs shape social policy; if our beliefs about poverty were different, our  social and public policies about poverty would be different. If we believed  that racism and oppression accounted for a good deal of poverty, there would be  a greater emphasis on social rights and social responsibility, on economic  opportunity programs, on progressive rather than regressive taxation, on the  right to living wages with retirement benefits, and on access to good education  and health care.
<H3>Are There Any Valuable Ideas?
</H3>
<P>Ruby Payne's popularity attests to the urgent need for  answers to the questions and concerns of teachers and administrators who  sincerely want to help children from lower socioeconomic status achieve  educational equity. We know that the learning, academic achievement, and social  development of students who are in poverty can be affected positively or  negatively by the attitudes of teachers and administrators. Payne's intention  of helping teachers and administrators become aware and appreciate the  circumstances of people who seem unfamiliar to them is an honorable one; the  problem is, as that intention is realized, it is riddled with factual  inaccuracies and harmful stereotypes. 
<P>Payne places  a good deal of emphasis on the fact that children in poverty would benefit from  more explicit instructional strategies to help them understand and think about  ideas presented in class &mdash; strategies like graphic organizers and multiple  approaches to learning about a concept. There is some truth to this premise.  But well-established research has demonstrated that <I>all</I>  children benefit from the strategies she suggests in her workshops. Payne is  not wrong to promote them, but she did not invent them and deserves neither the  credit nor the financial remuneration she receives for suggesting common  instructional practices to help low-income children. 
<H3>What Do We Need to Know?
</H3>
<P>Instead of allowing ourselves to be misled about a  culture of poverty, we need to critically examine the culture of denial that  has become institutionalized in our society and has caused the study of poverty  in the last 20 years to be more concerned with promoting a theory of individual  culpability than with addressing institutionalized inequities. We need to  understand that the poor themselves are not the problem; the problem is the  fact that the poor do not have realistic opportunities to escape from poverty.
<P>The  real answers aren't easy ones. They require us to work at all levels within the  system and outside of it as advocates and change agents for children and  families. We need to work collaboratively with organizations and political  movements that fight for systemic improvement of the lives of children and  families in poverty and strive to ensure people's basic human rights to  adequate food, housing, medical care, decent education, and an equal  opportunity to succeed. 
<P>There are  teachers who celebrate small successes with significant numbers of children  from poverty every day, against enormous odds. They remind us that existing  answers are not secrets we need pay big bucks to learn. Their answers are free:  It takes hard work and unwavering dedication. It takes committed teachers and  administrators willing to set high expectations and offer engaging curricula  that make strong personal connections for their students. It takes schools  where students are not just prepared to take and pass standardized tests, but  where they are taught how to play a conscious, active role in society, how to  recognize and combat racism and other institutionalized inequities, and how to  work in pursuit of the dream of social and global justice.</P>
