<h3 class="title">Why Ruby on Rails won't become mainstream</h3>

<p align="center">
<img src="http://beust.com/pics/crossing-chasm.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
<em>Update: here is a <a href="http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000471.html">follow-up to this article</a>, written two years later</em>


<p>You won't be reading any Ruby on Rails bashing in this blog post for a simple 
reason:&nbsp; I love Ruby and I love Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>Rails is a fantastic framework built on a wonderful language that appealed to 
me the very first day I started to study it.&nbsp; I think David did a fantastic 
job in two areas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Coming up with innovative ideas that take Web programming to a new level.</li>
	<li>Leveraging the strength of Ruby to achieve his goal.</li>
</ul>
<p>To tell the truth, the Pick Axe and Agile Web Development with Rails books are 
the best two technical books I have read these past years.&nbsp; I read 
quite a few technical books, but none has caught my interest and made me look 
forward to resuming my reading more than these two books.&nbsp; And to top it 
all, features such as Headless Applications, as illustrated in this
<a href="http://www.clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2006/04/04#HeadlessApp">blog post 
by Mike Clark</a>, clearly show how powerful Rails is.</p>
<p>There is no denying that Ruby on Rails is turning the Web programming world 
on its head.</p>
<p>Now that this introduction is out of the way, I'd like to take some time to 
explain why, in spite of all its qualities, Ruby on Rails will never become 
mainstream.</p>
<p>As you probably guessed, my conviction doesn't come from technical grounds.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The truth is that there are a lot of forces involved in making a Web 
framework successful, but before I dive into those, allow me to tell a little 
side story.</p>
<p>Have you ever come across Smalltalk or Lisp programmers?&nbsp; You know, 
these people who, no matter what you tell them, will always respond that 
&quot;Smalltalk did that twenty years ago&quot; or that &quot;Nothing has been invented since 
Lisp&quot;.&nbsp; They listen to you patiently with an amused light in their eyes and 
when you're done talking, they will just shrug away your points and kindly 
recommend that you read up on a thirty-year old technology that was the last 
thing they ever learned and that has been dictating every single technical 
judgment they have offered since then.</p>
<p>I believe that in ten years from now, people will look back at Ruby on Rails and will 
have the same reaction.&nbsp; I'm not sure what Web frameworks we will have by then, but I'm quite convinced that a lot of the current 
Ruby on Rails fanatics will have the same kind of attitude:&nbsp; &quot;That's nice, 
but Ruby on Rails already did this ten years ago, and better&quot;.</p>
<p>Interestingly, they might even be right.&nbsp; But by then, it won't matter 
because despite its technical excellence, Ruby on Rails will still be a niche 
technology that only experts know about.</p>
<p>So why do I think that Ruby on Rails will never cross the chasm?</p>
<ul>
	<li>First of all, <b>Ruby</b>.<br>
	<br>
	Again, and at the risk of repeating myself:&nbsp; I love Ruby.&nbsp; I truly 
	do.&nbsp; It's one of the few languages that I have studied these past years 
	that made me go &quot;Yeah!&quot; whenever I read about a feature I didn't know of 
	yet.&nbsp; I find its syntax and concepts extremely elegant and powerful at 
	the same time.&nbsp; I don't like everything about it, of course, but Ruby 
	is by far the number two language in my toolbox behind Java, with number 
	three far, far behind.&nbsp; But it's a complex language that contains a lot 
	of advanced idioms which will be very hard for PHP and Visual Basic 
	programmers to absorb.<br>
	<br>
	Admittedly, PHP and Visual Basic are cheap targets (we're talking about 
	languages that don't even have name spaces!), but like it or not, they are 
	the Web standard.&nbsp; Anyone who wants to succeed in the Web arena must 
	have a compelling story to tell to these programmers, something that will 
	convince them to switch to Rails on technical grounds but that will also be 
	an easy sell to their management.&nbsp; Rails can't succeed without these 
	two conditions, and I am predicting that Ruby -- and Ruby on Rails -- will 
	always remain a tough sell to any organization that contains more than ten 
	people.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Ruby on Rails itself</b>.<br>
	<br>
	Ruby on Rails is just too advanced.&nbsp; I'm serious.&nbsp; It has an 
	incredible amount of slick features involving a lot of magic (both 
	Ruby-related and invented by David himself).&nbsp; For talented developers, 
	these features are a dream come true...&nbsp; autowiring of the MVC, 
	scaffolding, defaults over configuration, unit tests (even integration tests 
	now, nice!), you name it.&nbsp; David hit every single pain point that Web 
	developers (regular developers even) have been facing these past years.&nbsp; 
	Ruby on Rails in itself is a great example of how to nicely package what we 
	have learned about software development these past five years.<br>
	<br>
	But it's still a very wide gap for corporate developers to cross.&nbsp; 
	Sometimes, too much magic<b> is</b> too much magic, and it can definitely be 
	the case that the flow of code is too direct or too clever to be 
	understandable by regular developers.&nbsp; Developers were able to do the 
	jump from imperative to object-oriented programming, but it was a hard 
	fight.&nbsp; I don't believe the Web world will ever be ready to embrace the 
	Rails cleverness.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Still <b>no credible IDE</b>.<br>
	<br>
	All fanatics of dynamic languages are quick to point that they don't need an 
	IDE to use Ruby, Python, Groovy or other.&nbsp; And they will quickly add 
	that if you need one, you're probably not being rubyic or pythonic enough 
	and that you should probably switch back to your old language and leave the 
	grown ups alone.<br>
	<br>
	This is nonsense.&nbsp; Ignore these people, they don't understand how the 
	real world works and how developers think, and they are one of the reasons 
	why so many great technologies never make it to the mainstream.&nbsp; Don't 
	ever be ashamed to need an IDE or to ask for one.&nbsp; Of course, there are 
	bad ways to use an IDE (e.g. you want code generated for you) but if you are 
	interested in Ruby on Rails, chances are that you are a decent developer and 
	you know how to leverage an IDE to make you more productive than when using 
	emacs.&nbsp; Code completion or navigation, debugging, refactoring, project 
	management, source control integration, etc...&nbsp; there are too many 
	features to list that make you more productive if you use a tool that 
	enables them.<br>
	This is 2006, not 1996.&nbsp; The programs we are writing and the problems 
	we are solving every day are orders of magnitude harder than back then, and 
	our tools need to keep up with that need.&nbsp; Emacs is a fine text editor, 
	but it's no longer adequate for modern development.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Fanaticism</b>.<br>
	<br>
	Regular readers of my blog know how strongly I feel on this topic.&nbsp; 
	There are exceptions, of course, but the attitude of Ruby on Rails users 
	toward Ruby skeptics or critics has been less than kind.&nbsp; This is a 
	crowd convinced that it has found the ultimate answer to everything, and 
	they are not afraid to let you know.&nbsp; I only have a simple advice for 
	these people:&nbsp; you might be right, but just be humble.&nbsp; It never 
	hurts.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Crowd of a single mind.</b><br>
	<br>
	If you want to write a Web application in Ruby, there is only one solution.&nbsp; 
	Only one.&nbsp; Ruby on Rails.<br>
	<br>
	Ruby on Rails has pretty much nuked the field of Web development in Ruby, 
	and I wonder if it's such a good thing.&nbsp; For all the flak that Java 
	receives because you can count at least a dozen different Web frameworks, 
	there is something to be said about plurality and the constant chase for 
	something better and different.&nbsp; Each framework that comes out builds 
	on the strengths of its ancestors while discarding the errors (and 
	committing a few mistakes of its own, of course). The field advances a 
	little bit every time while bowing down to the timeless laws of natural 
	selection.<br>
	<br>
	I am worried that Ruby on Rails will do to the Ruby world what JUnit did to 
	Java:&nbsp; a great tool when it came out but which condemned its community 
	to an ice age where no innovation or competition appeared for years.&nbsp; 
	Whatever the fate of Ruby, I hope its fans will keep an open mind and will 
	constantly challenge the Rails way, for the simple reason that it's always 
	healthy to question what's in place, no matter how good it looks.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Enterprise capabilities and scalability unclear.</b><br>
	<br>
	This is an argument that the Rails crowd doesn't take well, and they are 
	quick to point out BaseCamp and other products.&nbsp; The problem is that by 
	now, there should be other obvious success Rails stories, and not just ones 
	developed by the Rails Society.&nbsp; Of course, it's a chicken and egg 
	problem:&nbsp; a lot of companies evaluate Ruby on Rails but will only take 
	the jump if they can find evidence that other companies have done that 
	before them.&nbsp; And for now, the evidence is scarce at best.<br>
	<br>
	Granted, Java took a while to rise to the enterprise challenge as well, and 
	it did so despite tremendous initial handicaps such as poor performances and 
	questionable specifications.&nbsp; I contend that until Rails goes through 
	its own EJB2 debacle, it won't be seen as enterprise ready.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Lack of support from Internet Providers.</b><br>
	<br>
	What's the big deal with this, you ask?&nbsp; After all, Java is
	<a href="http://www.indicthreads.com/articles/427/shared_java_hosting_php.html">
	hardly supported by Internet Providers as well</a>.&nbsp; The big difference 
	is that Java on the server is targeted at the enterprise.&nbsp; Anyone who 
	wants to run a Java EE application will most likely host their own servers.<br>
	<br>
	Ruby on Rails is targeting a different population:&nbsp; the &quot;Web sites 
	in-between&quot;, these sites that are not massively scalable but still have more 
	than a few visits per day.&nbsp; A lot of these people use external hosting, 
	and they won't go very far if Rails is not offered natively and 
	pre-installed for them.&nbsp; PHP is a no-brainer for them, because it's 
	installed virtually on 99% of Internet Providers.<br>
	<br>
	Of course, a little bit of <tt>.htaccess</tt> magic will allow you to run 
	your own Rails application, whether your provider supports it or not, and 
	assuming that they give you that amount of privileges and that you don't 
	need to scale too high, but until Ruby on Rails achieves at least half of 
	the PHP penetration, it will remain inaccessible to most of the population 
	it needs to become mainstream.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that I didn't say anything about poor error reporting, weak internationalization support or Active Record, which 
are usually the areas where Ruby on Rails is the most criticized.&nbsp; I'm not 
worried about these because they are simply a symptom of Ruby on Rails' youth.&nbsp; 
They will be fixed in time, and I don't think they will play a big role in Ruby 
in Rails' acceptance (or lack thereof).</p>
<p>So there you have it.&nbsp; My prediction on Ruby on Rails in one, lengthy 
post.&nbsp; I apologize for the size of this article, I usually try to keep my 
blog entries short and to the point.&nbsp; I hope at least that I achieved the 
latter.</p>
<p>I'll conclude on a positive note:&nbsp; I hope I'm wrong.&nbsp; I really, 
sincerely do.&nbsp; For my next work, I want to have a choice between Java and 
Ruby, but right now, when in doubt, even <i><b>I</b></i> usually end up 
returning to Java for my personal projects for the reasons listed above.</p>
<p>And as you know, I love it when frameworks and languages compete for my 
business.&nbsp; But right now, I see no competition.</p>

<div class="comments-body">
<p>First, Thanks for this post and I'd like to say: I do agree with almost all of your arguments.</p>

<p>But ;) not on the conclusions...</p>

<p>Well I'm not a fortune teller ;)</p>

<p>> First of all, Ruby.<br />
Ruby (advanced features) are complex but ruby leverage the learning curve. You can start by learning few tricks and then get better by the time... Back then when I learned Java it was more painfull :( (I started with Jtable in a swing applet, arg! bad memories!)</p>

<p>> Anyone who wants to succeed in the Web arena must (...) convince programmers<br />
I think the blog video did just that ;)<br />
> (...) also be an easy sell to their management.<br />
Something that must be done and will be hard but the fact that many rails developpers are coming from j2ee and are well known architects will surely help...<br />
take a look at gary's post http://www.jroller.com/page/dgeary?entry=tipping_rails</p>

<p>> Ruby on Rails itself.<br />
Magic is good because it makes developpers more productive which is something your pointy haired boss will surely like ;)</p>

<p>> Still no credible IDE.<br />
I'm not a vi/emacs addict at all!<br />
But you must have missed something call "radrails".<br />
It's an amazing plugin who just won an eclipse award (http://www.radrails.org/blog/show/56)<br />
Take a look at it ;)</p>

<p>> Fanaticism<br />
I hope I'm not like one of those lisp guys ;)<br />
I agree that staying humble is the way to go since rails is not perfect either</p>

<p>> Crowd of a single mind.<br />
There are other inovative web frameworks (http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/camping/)<br />
But The fact that one of them is the reference is a breath of fresh air coming from J2ee (I think there are to many of them out there).<br />
Also this didn't bothered the ASP developpers to have only one option during all the last past years...</p>

<p>> Enterprise capabilities and scalability unclear.<br />
I found some amazing numbers about the shift to rails (http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/articles/2006/02/01/secrets-behind-ruby-on-rails-the-numbers)<br />
400 000 Downloads<br />
550 develppers / 50 countries<br />
25000 Agile web dev with rails books sold<br />
(http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/12/ruby_book_sales_surpass_python.html)<br />
o'reilly ruby books sales up to +1552% since last year<br />
more than python book sales</p>

<p>About performances see the great post of Justin Gehtlan (http://blogs.relevancellc.com/articles/2005/04/04/some-numbers-at-last)<br />
who wrote http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/bfljava/<br />
The numbers are amazing too!<br />
He just changed is blog look, the post is just one big block :(</p>

<p>> Lack of support from Internet Providers<br />
Rails is young but I sure it will come at time goes by... you already have http://www.typhon.net/en/ if you're looking for one ;)</p>

<p>When I can choose between java and rails, I personnaly take rails because I don't want to use my spare time on configuring hibernate mapping files and making yet an other ant file ;)<br />

<p>I think you make some good points Cedric but Rails is still young and, as you acknowledge, has a lot going for it. Call me optimistic but fast forward to 2008 and I reckon many of the obstacles you mention, whether perceived or real, will no longer exist.</p>

<p>While I don't agree with every single point it is still an excellent post, thank you.</p>

<p>But at least with your "Crowd of a single mind" you are wrong. There is Nitro (http://www.nitrohq.com/) which is under active development and has been around about as long as RoR. It is not well known to the public right now but everyone who gets really serious about RoR will come across it sooner or later.</p>

<p>I don't know if it ever will gain such popularity and momentum as RoR but it is an alternative with its own pros and cons.</p>

<p>So I agree with you: There is only one well known and documented solution (RoR) but there certainly is another serious/well written one out there (there may be more I don't know of)</p>

<p>> contains a lot of advanced idioms which will be very hard for PHP ... programmers to absorb</p>

<p>I can't speak for VB programmers but talking with people at phpLondon, quite a few of them are interested and/or working in ruby / rails. I think the interest is there and that there are just as many people coming to ruby from a php background as from a java background. The pain point may be different - i.e. people from a php background may be looking for a MORE structured approach. Countless php job adverts specify Java as a skill requirement - frequently this has nothing to do with actually using Java on the job but more to do with working with an OO/structured approach. Ruby may hit that sweet spot.</p>

<p>> Developers were able to do the jump from imperative to object-oriented programming, but it was a hard fight</p>

<p>Similarly it may be a hard fight to convince people of the benefits of using rails; that doesn't mean that it is a fight that can't be won.</p>

<p>> Crowd of a single mind</p>

<p>There was an interesting issue raised on the RoR podcast about this and risk - i.e. Your choice is between Java (low risk) and Ruby (high risk) as a language. However, once this has been selected, you then have to make choices on the framework / ORM / templating language etc. etc. In the Java world (and also in the php world) there are a plethora of options - leaving you exposed to some high risk choices. Ruby only really has rails, leaving only a low/no risk choice once you have selected the language.</p>

<p>> Enterprise capabilities ... unclear</p>

<p>This is a fair point (although not necessarily in terms of scalability). It is easy to shift unintentionally from the mindset that "RoR is better 90% of the time" to "RoR is better 100% of te time". It may turn out that the 10% of cases where RoR isn't better is what the enterprise really cares about.</p>

<p>I do wonder a little at how good Ruby would be when used by large teams as there can be so much magic going on and people extending classes all over the place that its sometimes a bit hard to know what really is going on - especially if you join a project 1 year after the development finished. Don't get me wrong - I love Ruby too - and love the power, its just maybe its too powerful :).</p>

<p>When large teams are involved - or projects which last many years-  one of the most important things is how easy is it to understand what a piece of code does. When it comes to readability, sometimes more verbose code thats trivial to understand is way more useful than one or two lines of extreme-ninja cleverness with jedi mind tricks :)</p>

<p>We spend way more time in the real world reading code, written by someone else some time ago than churning out brand new stuff quickly; while Rails rocks for the latter I'm not yet sure how good it is at the former.</p>

<p>But competition is great; I'm hoping both Java and Ruby continue to improve and get better.</p>

<p>Nice article, only one thing: I'm not sure why you think that in 10 years, there could be Smug-RoR-Weenies who will say "Ruby On Rails  did that first". I'd say, Java and other systems had many of the features before RoR, but RoR got them right by learning from their mistakes. So, unlike the Smug-{Smalltalk|Lisp}-Weenies, old Rubyists can talk about how they got things right...</p>

<p>What is it that Ruby has that Smalltalk doesn't? What makes Ruby an improvement on Smalltalk? Why should I program in Ruby and not Smalltalk (or Squeak)?</p>

<p>Cedric,</p>

<p>I agree with what you are saying for the most part, but the integration argument may not be as bad as everyone thinks. With Web Services making another push with SOA architectures, ROR is positioned OK. The web services support is pretty intuitive and I have to admit it beats Java Web Services support IMO.</p>

<p>The things that are a sore spot for me, at least from an integration viewpoint, is the lack of asynchronous processing(ie JMS), thin at best operational support (ie JMX), and deployment issues in general. And I still haven't seen a great solution for multiple application deployments without Session management problems.</p>

<p>But like you said, the ROR community is tenacious in their defense of the framework, so I'm sure they will solve these problems over time.</p>

<p>Shu Chow has hit the nail right on the head. Go into any Fortune 100 or 500 IT department and talk to the  "architecture team" that set's corporate direction  and see how many even know what Ruby or RoR is. </p>

<p>It will take years of progression both at the grass roots level (there usually are small teams that are talented and tend to experiment) and at the CIO level usually because some high paid consultants or analysts (Gartner) are waving the banner. </p>

<p>To Jan Prill, please don't prop Penny Arcade as some exaple of Rails' scalablity. As I understand it, the app doesn't even run dynamically, they use tools written in ROR to generate static HTML, so the number of ROR users is in single digits while Apache does the heavy lifting of serving millions of HTML files. More importantly the PA crew has had trouble since switching to ROR with not being able to make updates with the tools and/or updates not being available to the viewers....to the point where Tyco made a public apology for the constants delays a week or two ago. This is not a bright shining light of Ruby scalability...and it's not really an 'enterprise' app to start with, it's a glorified blog.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>when reading your article, it occurred to me that all the arguments you used (maybe beside the one about complexity of RoR itself) were actually used to tell us why PHP will never be mainstream.</p>

<p>This was back in 1998 or so, but hey!</p>

<p>What I want to say is that only time will tell. There's no point in speculating now what's going to be mainstream then. Personally, I think ruby has some nice advantages over PHP for example and I think with the time progressing it really might break through.</p>

<p>If it doesn't, it won't stop me using RoR though as it fits my needs in many projects.</p>

<p>@adw: Ok, admitted. But does that mean that rails doesn't scale? All I've said is that cedric didn't made his research homework. There are rails apps that scale. Look at the wiki page and ask people before writing that there is no proof that rails scales other than the 37signals products. It scales as well as any other technology that shares nothing. PHP scales great for yahoo. Scaling is a matter of the setup and isn't 'easy' on java either. Once again: It's amazing what DHH and the community of rails did with ror and their tools (capistrano) that address your scaling needs.</p>

<p>I'm not sure it matters if Rails hits the mainstream. Its hit "mainstream enough" that most web developers have at least heard of it by now. If fortune 500s aren't using or exploring new things, its because they're completely entrenched.</p>

<p>Rails is perfect for quickly setting up satellite applications around monolithic enterprise apps through web services. If the architects aren't looking at ways to speed things up, they will start losing ground in their respective marketplaces to quicker, dryer methods like Rails.</p>

<p>Crowd of a single mind</p>

<p>Many things drew me to Rails and this was one of the major reasons.  I try to use open source software when I can to solve problems and the number one issue that I find is that most of the projects never come close to being feature complete.  I'm always waiting for a feature in the next release or two releases from now.  I think that a lot of this is due to the lack of focus.  Linux on the desktop is a great example of this.  Gnome and KDE each have features that the others need, but we can't get together and have one great application.  The Java web frameworks suffer from this as well and can make it very important to choose the right solution for your project.</p>

<p>If the Rails community can continue to innovate and remain focused on it goals, it will continue to grow.  Dividing the limited resources of the open source community only hurts its adoption.</p>

There are entirely too many people sucking on the Microsoft breast to ever consider open source stuff like this. PHP and J2EE have too much of a following and that will continue to go on if nothing else but legacy support or the pain of converting everything to a new language.

<p>The IDE argument is not convincing. For example most people are using eclipse, because it helps you write all the java boilerplate code. This is just not the case with ruby.</p>

<p>Graphical IDEs are easy to learn, but nothing beats the productivity of Emacs, which is in fact an IDE. Writing some elisp code is so much easier to start with as to write an IDE plugin.</p>

<p>Emacs supports a wide range of development tools, an IDE just cannot compete with it. Maybe a ruby class browser is missing, but using outline mode is much faster than switching to mouse all the time.</p>

<p>The IDE argument is not convincing. For example most people are using eclipse, because it helps you write all the java boilerplate code. This is just not the case with ruby.</p>

<p>Graphical IDEs are easy to learn, but nothing beats the productivity of Emacs, which is in fact an IDE. Writing some elisp code is so much easier to start with as to write an IDE plugin.</p>

<p>Emacs supports a wide range of development tools, an IDE just cannot compete with it. Maybe a ruby class browser is missing, but using outline mode is much faster than switching to mouse all the time.</p>

<p>I agree with all of your points; as much as I'd love to see RoR succeed and take over the world, it's not likely to happen in its current state.</p>

<p>One thing that IMHO stops widespread adoption more than any other factor is the lack of a full-blown reference architecture/application, PetStore style. Look at the latest distribution of Spring - you can learn a ton from code in the samples/* directory, clean real world implementations of all the best practices in Java EE. Where is the Ruby equivalent?</p>

<p>Fact is, RoR might be great for writing blog engines (as if we don't have enough already), but why oh why isn't there a standard security model? Why must I spend hours downloading weird plugins & code generators to do something that a Java web container does out of the box?</p>

<p>Jan Prill : I didn't say Ruby or Rails didn't scale, I called you on using PA as an example of Ruby in a high traffic environment. PA is a high traffic website, but the ROR is not invoked by 99% of the page hits. As such it's pretty meaningless to the discussion at hand. If there are better example, then bring them forward in the discussion - PA isn't one.</p>

<p>I don't know if this is true. In fact the most php-developers (I know) don't like PHP at all. If there a chance to switch to a advanced oo language they would do it at once! (And JAVA has this kind of "enterprise-thinking" most of em don't like)</p>

<p>I am curious what framework you are using for your Java development. I've been using the Fusebox framework since 2001 and it has served me well. I started out using it when I was programming cold fusion and now while programming PHP. I'm finding that while it was a good solution in the past the framework is lacking from a progress and overall community strength point of view these days.</p>

<p>I've been looking for a new pasture to program for the past several months and so far it has been an uphill battle. I'm trying to balance the advantage of learning a new framework, a new language, and finding features that simply make me more productive than I have been in the past. Of course on top of that I plan on scaling my company to several programmers in the future so I want to pick one that will be popular amongst the masses.</p>

<p>In my search I've found the following to be the most interesting.</p>

<p>Turbo Gears (Python) - http://www.turbogears.org/<br />
Tapestry (Java) - http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/<br />
Zend Framework (PHP) - http://framework.zend.com/<br />
Atlas (.NET) - http://atlas.asp.net/Default.aspx?tabid=47</p>

<p>And of course Ruby On Rails.</p>

<p>In general my requirements are the following.</p>

<p>1. Rapid Development<br />
2. Simplified Maintenance<br />
3. Evolving and Community Accepted<br />
4. Long Term Viability<br />
5. Object Oriented</p>

<p>Of course if anyone else has any opinion of what the best framework would be based on these requirements then please let me know. :</p>

<p>I think he you are way off the mark. RubyOnRails is *already* becoming more and more mainstream and I think you'll be seing LOADS of Rails jobs in a few years. Its attracting people from both sides of the spectrum, the smaller traditional PHP developers and enterprisey Java/.NET people.</p>

<p>On Ruby:</p>

<p>"But it's a complex language that contains a lot of advanced idioms which will be very hard for PHP and Visual Basic programmers to absorb."</p>

<p>Ruby is certainly not a complex language. You can do some complicated things with it but other than the mindset shift when it comes to certain Ruby syntax elements and idioms its a clean, easy to write language that isn't particularly hard, if you are even a half-decent developer. I can see it being strange for people coming from languages with more a C-style syntax like Java or PHP but its just a case of becoming used to it. And then there is the OO nature of Ruby - this should be no problem to Java developers and should only pose a problem to amateur PHP developers who have never touched OOP. </p>

<p>To be honest, if a programmer looks at Ruby and thinks "sheesh, thats too hard for me" they probably aren't a very good programmer anyway. Who cares?</p>

<p>On Rails: Yes, Rails can do some advanced things. So can PHP. Advanced/talented users will take advantage of these advanced things, amateurs wont. You seem to be having a hard time separating the amateur PHP hackers with little talent (who aren't going to go very far anyway) and the serious developers who already use things like OO, design patterns and unit testing etc.</p>

<p>No credible IDE: pah. You don't need an IDE to be productive, especially when working with a dynamic language like Ruby. Textmate rules, I'd use that any day over any bloated Eclipse-style solution (but if that is your thing, RadRails is developing at quite a fast pace).</p>

<p>"This is 2006, not 1996.  The programs we are writing and the problems we are solving every day are orders of magnitude harder than back then, and our tools need to keep up with that need.  Emacs is a fine text editor, but it's no longer adequate for modern development.["</p>

<p>Such utter nonsense. Text editors like Emacs, Vim, Textmate or whatever your preference can be very powerful and combined with a bit of command line proficiency can be a powerful and productive development environment. I certainly wouldn't hire anybody who relied on an IDE to be productive - its a crutch, nothing more.</p>

<p>Enterprise and scalability - the old chestnut that has been shot down time and time again. Rails scales - its already scaling for quite a few large, high traffic websites. People who spend all their time wondering about "can it scale" can kiss my arse. As for enterprise - well clearly there are going to be things Rails or Ruby aren't suited to. Thats a given. Use the appropriate tool for the job - but for probably 80-90% of web-based apps Rails does the job and does it well.</p>

<p>What a load of dross.</p>

<p>Heh! So, what? I didn't become a professional programmer to be part of "the mainstream".</p>

<p>(OK, I answer this myself below (^_^), but I just don't weight this factor that heavily.)</p>

<p>"they will just shrug away your points and kindly recommend that you read up on a thirty-year old technology that was the last thing they ever learned and that has been dictating every single technical judgment they have offered since then."</p>

<p>I grew up on IDEs & C (& eventually, C++). I've kept up with the times: Perl, Java, Ruby, EcmaScript, &c. It's only been recently that I've really gotten into Lisp/Scheme/Smalltalk/&c.</p>

<p>Yet, I still see little reason to use the newer languages instead of modern versions of the old ones. Scheme is malleable enough to do anything the newcomers can do just as well.</p>

<p>Sure, there's the benefits of a larger community that can be very important, but it doesn't change the fact that most of these new languages aren't really providing much new while leaving out much of what came before.</p>

<p>"Code completion or navigation, debugging, refactoring, project management, source control integration, etc..."</p>

<p>I've used IDEs, & I've used sets of individual tools that work well together. Both can provide the same features. 6 one, 1/2 a dozen the other. (Although I *could* go into the reasons why I've come to prefer the latter.)</p>

<p>What makes you think that people aren't already saying that about Rails?  RoR is inordinately appealing to people who have never used a dynamic language before.  But most people who've been doing web development for a long time have used and/or created similar (often proprietary, sadly) frameworks using &lt;insert dynamic language here&gt; long before Rails was a twinkle in anyone's eyes.  RoR is significant because of its notoriety, not its technology or design.</p>

<p>Hmm...</p>

<p>Several of your points revolved around how Ruby and Rails are too advanced for most people. I'm not sure what you're trying to do by pointing that out other than instill defeatist feelings. Why not encourage people to push their boundaries? Scary, yes, but guess what: mainstream is *never* the best, and there's no reason not to keep pushing things forward. Afterall, why do you get up every day? Just to get by, sure, but is that enough? I sure hope not.</p>

<p>Speaking of mediocrity, the "no IDE" argument, even with the word "credible" jammed in their, is FUDing of the shoddiest variety. If the people using an editor like Textmate, irb, all the awesome Rails scripts like breakpointer and console, etc. wanted to, they could call that collection of tools and IDE. But what's the point? It's just another bullshit term used to market something that already existed without a name.</p>

<p>As for fanatacism... this is a general human problem and it is unecessary to tie it to something this specific. Zealots are assholes no matter what the topic. Ignore them and do your thing. End of story.</p>

<p>On that note, I appreciate DHH's passion and what some call a lack of humility... it's refreshing in today's world, particularly software development where so many are stodgy and surprisingly conservative for a group using such creatively free and expressive technologies that come in a million different colors, shapes and sizes. I agree he can be abrasive and confrontational, but again... people... who isn't at times? Are you gonna let that bother you or judge the issue on its merits?</p>

<p>Cedric's got a point.  I think the thing that's helped Perl and Python is that they're used for other scripting tasks, too.  You get a double kick if you can use a language for OS scripting, application development, and web development, too.  Yeah, I know Ruby can be used for those things, too... but it ain't.  By the time it is, the Perl and Python communities will have developed a Rails like paradigm.  </p>

<p>Sadly, most businesses view open source products as too risky.  That limits the growth of Ruby, further.  ASP, .net, the VB's ... they are just going to grow bigger... it's a safe management choice.  Ruby will have to grow at a cost to Perl, PHP, and Python.</p>

<p>I don't know who said it, but Ruby's growth depends on a big glamorous, risk-taking, company like Google or Lucas Film adopting it.  And, that takes time that Ruby doesn't have.</p>

----- >8 -----</p>

<p>(I'm assuming you're talking about Web programs.)</p>

<p>I don't see that being the case at all. Can you explain how a transaction in your average current Web app is fundamentally more complicated than one in a 10 year old shopping cart program? You either pull data from a data store (RMDBS, record manager, flat file, session, whatever) and show it to the user or take data from the user, validate it, and stick it in the data store. Some Web applications do some actual work themselves, but the vast majority don't, and there were Web applications doing complex things back then.</p>

<p>In fact, I'd argue that it's *less* complicated now because we have a lot more and better libraries than we did then and they're much easier to get working. We've got easy access to pre-compiled RDBMSs, don't have to deal with record managers anymore, we've got templating libraries, database connection pooling, parsers, generators, and strippers for all types of formats, etc. that you rolled your own, went without, or paid heaps for 10 years ago. We had cgic and cgi-lib.pl and were  on our own for a lot of the rest.</p>

<p>We're doing pretty much the same work now that we were then and have access to better tools. I have no axe to grind with RoR one way or the other, but it's more complex because you choose to use complex frameworks that impose their own overhead instead of just using the APIs that you need. Just because you can use a framework doesn't mean you should. It doesn't mean you shouldn't, either, but it is worth thinking about.</p>

<p>Great Article.</p>

<p>Regardless of the ability of Rails to become mainstream/enterprise, it is a great time to be a programmer. It took a long time for the mainstream business apps to move from C to higher level abstractions like Java. I think the popularity of python and ruby (through Rails) are evidence of the desire of developers to move to the abstraction and flexibility even higher. Once this becomes commonplace, there will most likely be an abudance of interesting time-saving frameworks to choose from.</p>

<p>We just have to be patient :)</p>

<p>One thing I do agree with is about having an advanced editor. Things like code completion and refactoring would be great to have with Ruby. I've been spoiled by Eclipse and now if I want to rename a Ruby method going back to using grep, or even using the global search and replace in TextMate is less than optimal. What makes it even more important (and difficult?) to have these features is the dynamic nature of Ruby. Screw something up, and you might not know for an hour until you do something that triggers compilation of that segments of code. (I know, I can hear DHH saying "Tests, grasshopper, you must write tests!"). While this is true, tests aren't a substitute for a modern IDE.</p>

<p>No IDE?</p>

<p>*looks over at other monitor, sees Rails project inside of Eclipse*</p>

<p>I don't know about you, but my IDE is based on the same framework as the Java industry standard: Eclipse. RadRails is a plugin for Eclipse, which means you also get the wonderful source control features available for Eclipse as well. As far as refactoring goes, refactoring is far simpler to do in dynamic languages (and the Rails project structure helps out quite a bit), so I really haven't had a problem with the lack of Java-equivalent refactoring tools. (And yes, it is available in plugin form. Guess what I'm using right now? They also have a standalone version.)</p>

<p>steamengine: Adding that capacity to Rails would be extremely simple. First, come up with a decent DSL for working with GUIs (probably borrowing a page from wxRuby). Second, write the glue code between that and whatever AJAX widget library you find appealing. Three, package it as a plugin for ActionView. Four, have a beer.</p>

<p>tom: Right now the application server for Rails is Lighty, but the Mongrel project is looking *very* cool, and may eventually resolve the whole "Apache hates FastCGI" problem (which is indeed a problem). It's a super-quick Ruby/C web server, designed for hosting single applications.</p>

<p>And Unicode... yeah, Unicode's a problem. Matz is on it, so hopefully we'll see this resolved in Ruby 2.0.</p>

<p>I was a (quite bad) amateur php programmer. The ease of use and rush of excitement I got when discovering Rails turned me into a professional. Ruby's syntax may be "advanced" from a technical perspective, but Rails' use of domain specific language principles made it so that even when I was just starting out I was able to read and understand what was happening in a Rails app far better than I even could in a php project (even of my own making).</p>

<p>Rails also makes it easier to do comprehensive testing than not to. After a year messing around in php, the term had never even entered my lexicon. Rails makes me a better programmer than I would ever have become in php.</p>

<p>I don't know about a lot of the "enterprise" issues you guys are talking about here, but I do know that there are about a zillion people out there who are either independent php contractors or engaged amateurs who want to do make a dynamic website for some particular real world use. These people make most of the websites in the world and Rails is a quantum leap in both ease-of-use and productivity for them.</p>

<p>And, even further, I think Rails will bring in a lot of new people to dynamic web programming who are currently not doing it at all. When I got interested in it and first started with php, I found it incredibly depressing. It took  an incredibly long time for me to accomplish any of the things I set out to do. Compare that to the famous Rails blog video.</p>

<p>I don't understand why you take namespaces to be some amazingly complex concept?  I'm just a lowly PHP (and java mind you) developer, but I find namespaces (and pretty much all OOP) to be a no-brainer: it all just "makes sense."</p>

<p>And this is from a guy who had to make the jump from (procedural|functional|imperical) programming to OOP.  </p>

<p>My only complaint - seemed like a low blow.  </p>

<p>Other than that, interesting article.  I won't jump on the Ruby bandwagon quite yet.  I'd like to see a little more mainstream acceptance.  When I can find even one Ruby programming job for every 20 PHP jobs - I'd consider it a language worth learning.  Until then its a toy, relegated to the uber geeks who'd rather spend time picking up a new language than really mastering the one they were already using. </p>

<p>If I disagree will I be labeled a fanatic? ;-)</p>

<p>First off: Yes, Ruby has lots of advanced features that your average VB, PHP programmer won't understand (initially) - features like closures, continuations, metaprogramming abilities - however, Ruby is quite approachable for newbies.  You can certainly learn a enough Ruby without getting into those advanced areas to get your job done.  Later on as the newby progresses they  get curious and learn the more advanced features (though one could argue that continuations need only be used by about 1% of Ruby developers - the other 99% can get by fine without ever delving into them).</p>

<p>You say that Rails is the only Ruby-based web programming framework in town, however that is not true, there's also Nitro which takes a different philosophical approach.  Yet even if Rails were the only game in town, it is a good game and in fact there is some evidence to suggest that the lack of choices in the Ruby Web programming space (and the fact that Rails is quite a good framework)is actually helping to some extent - it allows people to focus on Rails and the Rails ecosystem and perhaps it's less confusing for newbies.  (but again, there is Nitro which isn't known nearly as much as Rails, but it's worth a look.)</p>

<p>Certainly an interesting writeup, but I think the problem may be the opposite of what you report.</p>

<p>RoR maybe its own enemy by becoming too popular too quickly and not having the proper marketing and project management muscle behind it like Java did, so its going mainstream and having too many growing pains because the product was not designed for the enterprise.</p>

<p>If you look at the history, it was designed for a single project and was extracted out of that. In RoR, deploying multiple apps (written in RoR) is hair-y. Integrating two or three different apps is hair-y. Scaling and architecture solutions are simple-minded (just throw more hardware at it .. or something). </p>

<p>Take a look at all that pluralization nonsense which really wasn't needed, but was put in there on the whim of a developer whose native tongue isn't even English (ironic?), and who insists that a table containing person entities should be named 'people' because it "sounds right". EFCodd and relational theory/calculus be-damned!  </p>

<p>Like Chris Rock said, "You can drive your car with your feet, but that don't make it a great f**kkin idea!"</p>

<p>It is not a bad framework for one off CRUD front-ends to databases though. If by mainstream you meant Enterprise, then yeah, its got ways to go. No enterprise architect worth their salt will let this thing on their company's bread-n-butter servers in the condition its in right now.</p>

<p>Rails is hard to learn?</p>

<p>I'm teaching my technically inept girlfriend RoR. She's never had a day of programming or CS classes in her life.  She's never learned a programming language in her life.</p>

<p>Nothing, so far, has been confusing to her about RoR.</p>

<p>The "magic" that we take for granted, to people new to web frameworks, is just "the way things are."</p>

<p>Take scaffolding.  I hardly use that in my professional Rails career.  But for her, that's just like, a really nifty way to get a barebones webapp going.  I had to explain to her that, back in the day, you'd have to write all these silly little HTML forms by hand.</p>

<p>Re: going mainstream.</p>

<p>The point about PHP being "just there" on any *nix webhost is a valid point.</p>

<p>Will Ruby/RoR ever be like that?  Who knows.  It took PHP, what, 4-6 years to get where it is today?  It's certainly naive to say / believe that RoR will be just a "blip" on some radar in 2-4 years.</p>

<p>15-20 years?  Maybe.  But I doubt that too...  Is C/C++ now a "blip" on the radar?</p>

<p>I've never really felt lacking w/o a so-called "Rails IDE".  The coders I've known who were dependent too much on their editors, I never really respected that much.  Get them outside of Visual Studio .NET or Eclipse, and they were like children lost in the woods.</p>

<p>Of course, that's because bloated frameworks like ASP.Net and J2EE demand those editors.</p>

<p>And ... if anyone in the RoR scene is fanatical...  it's because we don't want to go back to our J2EE/ASP.Net/PHP worlds.</p>

<p>We don't care if *you* like it over there (that's all very fine and dandy), but don't make *us* go back.  The scenery is nice over here.</p>

<p>I have been programming since 1968. I've used assembler for many different computers, as well as Fortran, Snobol, Basic, Prolog, Pascal, C, C++, Forth (yuck), Logo, and many domain-specific languages; I've programmed scanners in lex, compilers in yacc and also in recursive descent Pascal and C; I reversed engineered and decompiled a sound-processing language, building a system which translating automatically from hex machine code to signal-flow diagrams; I've done a lot of embedded and/or real-time programming; I designed and implemented a bytecode Pascal system with real-time extensions; I've designed hardware, both analog and digital. I've worked extensively with cellular automata, including studying Von Neumann's papers and those of E.F. Codd, who later went on to create the core relational database concepts. I even built my own DTL (diode-transitor logic) gates "back in the day". I really do know computers from the electrons up.</p>

<p>My assembly-language work included some truly complex projects, programs which would not be trivial in any language, and which, given the slow processors and tiny memory resources available in their time period, could never have been programmed in any other language.</p>

<p>I've written complicated event-driven programs for the Macintosh, for Windows and even for a few one-off embedded architectures.</p>

<p>For the web systems I now create, I find it necessary to mix five languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. I could not say that any of those languages has been entirely trivial to learn up to the point of using them fluently. To create working web systems, I also have to understand .htaccess files, Unix permissions, Bash scripting, construction of crontab schedules, and other server concepts.</p>

<p>And (finally) here is my point: I have found PHP to be friendly, convenient and productive. Granted, I have so far used PHP as a solo programmer, so any problems with multi-programmer interactions have not arisen. Maybe that's where namespaces would be necessary. Otherwise I can't seem to think of a reason I would need that feature.</p>

<p>I find PHP to be concise and readable. I add a good number of comments to my code, so I can easily figure out how things work when I have to return to it later. I am annoyed that PHP does not really support Unicode or other multi-byte coding schemes, and that the combined use of single and double quotes can become confusing in some situations. Otherwise I am quite happy with the language.</p>

<p>We always read about end-user software that is supposed to be easy to learn and use. Why shouldn't the same criteria apply to programmers' software -- that is, to languages and development systems? </p>

<p>The fact is that the same criteria DO apply. Popular programming tools MUST be easy and intuitive to work with. They have to be simple enough to use that even people who are less gifted and/or less studious can be productive with them to some extent.</p>

<p>Finally, procedural languages work the way the underlying hardware works. That can be a real advantage when one is trying to get good performance.</p>

<p>I hope I have not shocked or disturbed anyone by speaking up for PHP. Doing so seems to be taboo in discussions like this one. But there must be SOME reason why PHP is so popular...</p>

Furthermore, academics have whole-heartedly embraced it as the best all-purpose OO language. Put together, that's a triumverate that's hard to beat. Until Rails sees that kind of corporate and academic support, I think it will stay a phenomenon for small- to mid-scale web development.</p>

Im not so concerned with the lack of development tools; Im more concerned with the lack of support for interfacing with other technologies.  I dont want to get into the Microsoft versus Linux debate, but if an organization has a substantial investment in Microsoft technologies (i.e. SQL server, Exchange, Active Directory)  then it has to have a tool that will help leverage that investment.  I want a tool that I can connect to a Microsoft SQL server instance as easily as I can connect to a mySQL instance.  I know a lot of developers who are just like me, we like ruby, its fun and easy to learn and powerful, but at work I need a tool that will interface to an Oracle database and a MSSQL database and an Exchange Server.  I need Ruby on Rails to work on IIS as easily as ASP.NET, or ColdFusion or even PHP.  I want a setup package that will configure Microsoft IIS while it installs ruby (just like PHP) Until I see more cross platform (i.e. Microsoft support) we could not recommend Ruby as a serious in house development tool.  </p>

<p>Corporate environments are not the place to test out new technologies, as I was quickly flamed by the guys who signed the procurement orders when I posted on our internal developer forum mentioning the benefits of Ruby on Rails. I can see it from their point of view, as the primary concern of a business is protection of investment, not experimentation. Even if the CTO of a large corporation joins the RoR cult, he will still have to justify to his superiors the savings and the risks of a large scale migration. This kind of barrier is what prevents RoR going mainstream. Having said that, taking a lesson from the Linux  books, every large corporation has a backdoor, namely developer adoption, so there is a way. Like you, I like Rails and all my websites are built using Rails, but the biggest premium is still being paid for Java/J2EE/ASP.NET developers, so that is what I do during the day in order to fund my nocturnal Rails projects.</p>

<p>@Matthias Georgi: He indicates that he can do code completion, navigation, debugging, refactoring, project management, source control integration, etc. all the time with emacs.</p>

<p>For Java, this is bogus.  The quality of these features in emacs is so far below the big Java IDEs, it's almost not fair to even compare them.  The next time someone says something like this to you, ask them to show you on their emacs screen - Then you will know what I'm talking about.  Usually people who make statements like this aren't aware of what a real IDE from this decade is actually capable of.</p>

<p>I'm in the midst of a small project at a large company to validate whether Ruby on Rails can be a useful enterprise tool. </p>

<p>I disagree with your conclusion that RoR will never find a place in enterprise computing. If you look at the question from the perspective of hard business value, it's clear there is a lot to gain from the sheer productivity of RoR. </p>

<p>As far as scalability goes, I think it's a non-issue. Enterprise computing isn't a one-size-fits-all proposition. Everything in an "enterprise" doesn't have to be gigantic or scalable to gigantic size. </p>

<p>Consider a technical environment that has a library of shared services and back-end resources that are accessible through those services. There are many projects to develop tactical, vertical, customer-facing business apps, and they're typically built on web technologies even if they're only for internal use, since web technologies are fairly standardized and straightforward. In that environment, creating one of those small business apps is a matter of orchestrating pre-built services, presenting a UI, and maybe writing a bit of custom logic here and there. Those little apps don't have to scale, because the heavyweight stuff is all in the back end infrastructure which is already scalable. </p>

<p>What sort of tool do you see fitting into that part of the enterprise? RoR looks like an excellent fit to me.</p>

<p>What I'm playing around with are things like connectivity with Active Directory, writing Web Services client code, and so forth. It's all pretty basic. RoR doesn't have to replace technologies like Java or .NET to have a well-justified place in enterprise computing where it can deliver real business value. Instead, it can complement those technologies in a way that takes advantages of its natural strengths.</p>

<p>I think we're all missing the point here. Ruby is the language and it's a beautiful language. Rails is the framework - in almost it's first iteration. It's  separate and distinct from Ruby and ultimately completely replaceable.</p>

<p>To argue about whether it will or won't see commercial uptake is largely irrelevant. What you should be considering is what Rails actually is. It's not a development environment and it's not the ten commandments; it's a web design paradigm that just happens to have been defined in code and it's real strengths are in it's enforcement of a (kind of) programming discipline that can be shared amongst a team, the abstraction of data integration into a 12-line config file and the ability to prototype a web application very rapidly.</p>

<p>This latter feature wins my approval and admiration. To be able to produce a workflow in a few minutes, that could potentially take hours or days in a PHP environment is a gift. Throwing AJAX in as well is just the icing on the cake. </p>

<p>Regarding the point made above about it being difficult to transfer skills from the PHP and ASP backgrounds that many web programmers have, I say - that's just our lookout. The irony is that it's probably easier to learn if you don't already have an appreciation of scripting languages because it seems to be based around common sense expectations. And if that really is the case, a lot more people will start to use it.</p>

<p>So to sum up: I think RoR has already done it's job because it's making people sit up and think about exactly how they want to build the next generation of web applications.</p>

<p>And it is great to see an idea take hold and create so much of a buzz on the internet *without* the marketing muscle of Microsoft or Sun or Oracle behind it.</p>

<p>on emacs "IDE":  I really don't quite get the productivity boost when using emacs as compared to eclipse.  Perhaps, the perception of what an IDE is makes this difference.  Eclipse can definitely do mouseless manipulations.  Modern, contemporary and GUI-based IDEs do have a lot of superior functionality as opposed to vi and emacs world.  I for one refused to get out of vi and to some extend windows notepad until I got converted to Eclipse.</p>

<p>on RoR:  As for RoR, IMHO, Java EE is still superior in terms of maturity and product and service support.  RoR can deliver a faster time-to-market, but will not scale up to most of large-scale enterprise requirements. I doesn't really matter whether the language/frameworks I use is from the evil ones (ie, M$, Sun, Oracle, etc.) as long as it gets the job done and does it well.  For years, we've seen Java delivers enterprise requirements and did it well.  </p>

<p>You don't, you can write your own in about the same amount of time and it's your code (that's the wonder of RoR).  But yes, there needs to be a consolidated effort to standardize some of the documentation.

<p>I work for a consulting firm that has some active rails projects.  What I am finding is that I bump my head up against the framework just as often as I do in any other language.  My personal preference?  Object Oriented-PHP 5 with no framework, aside from some basic code generation, but I don't feel like getting flamed here ;)<br />
Nobody seems to respect PHP 5 and its capabilities.  However, I see value in rails.  I don't think its the end-all-be-all answer to everything, but it certainly is a tool that I am glad I am adding to my portfolio.  I'm a firm believer in using the right tool for the job at hand so it never hurts to have alot of tools at your disposal.</p>

<p>"Emacs is a fine text editor, but it's no longer adequate for modern development."</p>

<p>Our team of five use Emacs in conjunction with our RoR-like web framework bOP, and we take advantage of code completion, debugging, refactoring, CVS integration, unit and acceptance testing, etc all from within Emacs. Our small team maintains an open source framework, an industry leading online application, several long term consulting projects and several start up companies.</p>

<p>Somehow we manage to be more productive than any other team of 5 or 25, at least that I know. Emacs doesn't hinder us. I still like Eclipse and IntelliJ, but I haven't used either in nearly a year and don't really miss them beyond their attractive UIs. Granted I rarely ever have the development headaches in bOP that I did in C++ or Java where "modern" IDEs help :)</p>

<p>Reading these comments are like a big deja vu for me.</p>

<p>Anybody remember 1995 when Java was released and people said:</p>

<p>"Java is a silly little language which is fine for running cute little dancing graphics, but we are serious programmers and we code in C or C++"</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>"Java isn't even compiled it won't scale nor compare to the speed of much more mature and compiled languages. "</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>"Wasn't Java created to handle TV Set boxes it won't be used to integrate into SAP or real backend systems."</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>"It's just a fad it will go away.  No company will throw away the millions of dollars invested in C,C++,Cobol and embrace Java."</p>

<p>Now reread this thread and simply substitute Java with RoR.... think about it.</p>

<p>While reading Cedric's article I had a hard time not thinking this was all just tongue-in-cheek writing.  </p>

<p>How does that argument work, most companies are too stupid to know how to use rails?  LOL!  While I don't disagree that many companies have too many mediocre coders, and too many self-inflated architects (AKA people who can't code or manage but we need to put them someplace) it just doesn't flow.  </p>

<p>Smart coders are always looking for better ways to do things... if it weren't for them we would all still be doing COBOL. :)</p>

<p>And what is the problem with arrogance?  That's the drive of an engineer; to show how you can do something faster, chea per, and/or better than the next guy. </p>

<p>I have heard DHH talk and I think those that complain about his "arrogance" are just too thin skinned, and/or envy what he has accomplished.</p>

<p>False modesty is for people who can't deliver...quit your whining and learn something new or you just might realize that you are the next coding dinosaur.</p>

<p>I have been in microsoft shops for over 10 years now.  which means i currently do .net(C# at the moment) and I always code at home with stuff i like.  I think RoR (and Ruby) is slick.  Do i feel really "weird" about the "magic".  you bet!  LOL.  but maybe that is not a bad thing...to stop writing all the DB infostructure and let some "magic" happen.  The one thing i have learned from writing enterprise solutions with 'enterprise' tools is most projects are TOTALLY over-engineered.  RoR is a tool, like Java, C#, PHP and VB(yes, classic VB has a place).  That is all it is.  Look at your project and go with what technolgy works best to make you productive.  Oh, an i would love a better IDE.  And web apps (not just websites) have become more complicated, i have evolved with that for over 10 years...started with notepad.  in unix world i use emacs still.  But an IDE is so much better.  not for writting me code (i would pull all that crap out anyway) but if anything else, just for the solution or project organization alone.  Hell, if i keep writing Rails apps, i might just write an IDE myself...we are developers aren't we?? hehe</p>

<p>Remember lesson #1 in business studies: supply and demand.  If there is demand, there will be supply.  For all the tooling and services around the Ruby on Rails, there will be supply *because* there is demand.

<p>The community is fanatical, no question. And yeah, it's turning into a monoculture -- though my guess is that diversity in ruby web development will manifest itself in extensions to Rails for various purposes. But I don't think that fanatics have usually prevented a technology from being adopted -- they've just made it more annoying to adopt. It certainly hasn't stopped Python.</p>

<p>Support from internet providers will come -- if there's a lot of people who want to buy something, someone will sell it to them. Likewise, an IDE or two will fall out somewhere -- that's just a matter of time.</p>

<p>As far as the complexity of Ruby, I call BS. If you're in a hurry to crank out your first Rails app and are working from a decent tutorial, you can learn a functioning subset of Ruby in no time flat. You won't understand any of the interesting parts of Ruby, but you can write functional code without it. And as bad as that sounds, it's still leagues ahead of what novice code looks like in PHP. Likewise, there are a ton of things going on in Rails that are fantastically advanced, but it does a good job of hiding them to the novice -- you can write My First Dynamic Website without  understanding any of the principles underlying Rails -- just the surface details of how to use it that you can glean from a tutorial.</p>

<p>Of course, the corollary to that is that there are going to be a lot of Rails sites produced by barely-literate codemonkeys -- just like with php or asp. But that's not a knock against the underlying technology.</p>

<p>The main legitimate question at this point is scalability. Right now, the whole execution path for Rails is shaky, from the single-threaded VM to the suboptimal hacks required to hook it up to a webserver. This aspect of Rails is still a mess. In my spare time, I've been tinkering around with a lisp interpreter running on top of asp.net, and I'm pretty sure that I would have an easier time scaling that up than doing a large-scale deployment of Rails.<br />

<p>I believe another obstacle in RoR's way is the Mac/Firefox centricness of the RoR core team. If you don't use TextMate on a Mac your not a real RoR programmer. And if rubyonrails.com does not always display right in IE, who cares, just switch to FF. BS!! I want to develop RoR on a Windows machine and test my apps in IE6 and 7. I think if a RoR website doesn't display right in IE7, it's the developer's fault!!</p>

<p>Maybe in your experience.  Change the "we" to an "I".  In my experience, "we" were doing wireless object-oriented app server/db work in 1996.  What were you doing?</p>

<p>Funny tho, you were just implying that Smalltalkers overstate the benefits you enjoy today.  Maybe it's because, in fact, they were working on those hard projects during their first iterations?</p>

<p>I disagree with some of the basic premises of this article. First, while not a full-blown IDE, RadRails is a pretty darned good code editor. If you want to see your work, keep your web page open and just hit the "refresh" button. Not exactly IDE but one of the best editors around and surely the next best thing to IDE.</p>

<p>Further, the author states that you don't want an IDE that generates code. That is pure nonsense!  That is what IDEs do! An IDE that did not generate code would be nothing but a screen generator. It would create screenshots that do not do anything, which is just plain not useful.</p>

<p>As for the first objection -- Ruby itself -- I can personally testify that it is a non-issue. I used Visual Basic since before it was even a Windows programming platform (yes, it was available in DOS, in two different forms). So I do know Visual Basic and actuall like some things about it. I have also done a lot of coding in .NET, Java, C++ and C#.</p>

<p>Yet, when I actually started programming in Ruby, and got past a couple of different concepts (symbols for example), I was extremely impressed. I dropped .NET like a hot potato. There is no comparison at all. Java, while nicely structured, is too restrictive for most really creative people. Not just technically restrictive... it FEELS restrictive. A friend of mine, who had a similar experience, asked me why anybody who had been exposed to Ruby should bother to learn Java at all. I replied that Java teaches (and enforces) good programming habits, while Ruby's freedom does not discourage sloppiness. So learn the proper way first, then carry your good habits over to the freer environment. And Ruby really is that.</p>

<p>The prediction that RoR will be a has-been ten years from now is pure speculation. I think that one was just pulled out of the air. I could say that about any Web tool in existence today and have an equal chance of being right.</p>

<p>The lack of ISP support is rapidly disappearing. Lack of support is a necessary initial condition when something new comes around... it takes time to properly support it. The very same thing was true of PHP, Perl, and even JavaScript at different times. There are LOTS of RoR-friendly hosts out there now, and if you do not think there is enterprise-level support, check out Engine Yard for one good example (http://www.engineyard.com/).</p>

<p>All in all, there are good rubuttals to every one of the objections to RoR listed in this article. The author is entitled to his/her opinion but I strongly disagree with most of them, and I have counterexamples on my side.</p>

<p>I played around with RoR for around a month and when I started a real project, I realized something very important about RoR. It maps my db structure directly into the model classes. I know this can be changed but once you write your own SQL query, not relying on the Active Record methods, you end up rewriting the whole CRUD functionality of the class and this relates the other related classes.<br />
I like the MVC web approach, but the convention over configuration for the db is too much for me. And what will happened when MySQL 5.1 becomes stable and we start using sql functions - Will Active Record allow us to use these. What about transactions. For now, even if I try to GROUP BY something HAVING..., it is done by adding part of the query to the one supposed to be build by Active Record.</p>

<p>Too much magic for me :( Is there someone trying to use RoR for something bigger than blog (Except for the Basecamp)</p>

<p>There have been tremendous advances made in computing frameworks since LISP was invented.  But LISP really did one heck of a lot of things right.

<p>By the way, this website is kind of broken (bad user experience). When I posted my message I didn't receive any response telling me it was a successful post. It just redirected me back here and my message is not displayed. I think this is the reason there are quite a few double posts in the comments above - because people were unsure if their message was posted so they resubmitted. Is this blog, perhaps, written with Ruby? I hope not, otherwise I will have a negative thing to say about Ruby developers ;)</p>

<p>Also, when I preview my post, there is an option for entering a website URL for reference.<br />
But before I preview the post, there is no URL text widget available. This again is a user experience issue that should be looked into. Not that some of my web programs don't have similar flaws which are written in freepascal, ruby, etc.</p>

<p>Getting away from shawls and viagra for a while!!!<br />
In regard to the original post on ROR : -<br />
1/ Yes, the Ruby language can be complex, but never illogical or seemingly abstract, something which could never be said of PHP or .NET. These die hard mainstrem programmers are not fools and must surely be able to see the merits of Ruby. How many are secretly wishing their company would allow them to embrace it?<br />
2/ Surely advanced in ROR's case doesn't mean overly difficult to learn. I don't consider myself to be anything special when it comes to web development, but with only a brief grounding in asp.net and php, I have found adapting to ROR both easy and quickly rewarding.<br />
3/ Up until recently, I would have agreed with the no credible IDE statement, but Aptana has certainly come of age as have many of the other text editor/IDE's available. More importantly Borland has now jumped on the bandwagon with the release of arguably the most comprehensive Ruby dedicated IDE ever (see http://www.codegear.com/products/3rdrail). If this proves to be what it purports, then I believe Ruby will have something akin to Visual Studio to back it (BTW there is also a VS plug-in available called Ruby In Steel).<br />
4/ ROR fanatics make no apologies for their fanaticism....sorry!!!<br />
5/ OK, so ROR has "nuked the field" but that is because it is so damn good. Probably the reason so many converts are fanatics!! I see no reason why, in the future, other clever developers will launch their own frameworks but at present most are content to embrace and add to the ROR framework, probably out of respect for its inherent design capabilities.<br />
6/ My, how long a year can be in the developer' world. There are now many enterprise success stories with ROR and I'm sure many more to come. As for scalability, well I believe that has been proven also<br />
7/ Hosting is not only available but is widely available,and extremely cost effective.</p>

<p>Fast forward 1.5 years from this article's publishing:</p>

<p>- Merb 0.4<br />
- Sequel, DataMapper, Ambition<br />
- JRuby 1.1<br />
- Official Netbeans Ruby Support<br />
- OS X 10.5 XCode support for Ruby</p>

<p>Rails has not "nuked" anything -- except perhaps to steal some of the bright minds from the Java world and import them into the Ruby community.  As with all development frameworks, the lessons learned from one feed into the successors.</p>

<p>- Merb leverages many of ActionPack's strengths while making up for its shortcomings.<br />
- Sequel provides simple ORM without as much of the complexity/magic of ActiveRecord.<br />
- Ambition is beginning to pull us away from SQL altogether by permitting the querying of data using plain Ruby syntax.</p>

<p>Rails has no more stymied Ruby innovation any more than applets initially did for Java.  Rails showed us the possibilities of Ruby.  As more people continue to contribute to the community, Ruby's potential will only be further realized.</p>

<p>In other words: it's all good.</p>

<p>Just curious, now that two years have passed, do you still feel accurate in your prediction that Rails would not become mainstream?</p>

<p>The reason I ask is that it seems pretty mainstream to me,as I watch large, stodgy organizations adopting it for large-scale projects.  And the various service providers who offer hosted Rails platforms, etc.</p>

<div class="comments-body">
<p>I suspect one reason RoR won't go mainstream is because of Groovy and Grails. The existing huge Java-based crowd of web developers are more likely to move to something that looks like what they're used to and which can even transparently use all their existing code base. </p>

<p>Plus Grails has the advantage of going second; it can learn from RoR's mistakes as well as its insights.</p>

<p>My reasoning for Ruby never really being use in critical applicatoin is this silly reason:  We had some of the Ruby guys come down to Citigroup to give a demo, I learned several things from that demo:<br />
- Like all American companies, they are leveraging their business contacts for both demo and purchasing.<br />
- Even though Ruby is suppose to be SO EASY, the demo guy had to setup the code before the visit and the code still crashed<br />
- The people who will make money from this scritping language is the company that owns Ruby and can market it well and the other benfetitors will be the bool writers</p>

<p>I wish all of you Ruby developers the best of luck, but I'll be about six months behind you cleaning up the Ruby mess and using Java Enterprise.</p>

<p>Private Fund Management - is an international investment company specializing in asset management services. During its long history, it has achieved and occupied a stable position in the financial market and won the confidence of numerous investors from all over the world. <br />
Asset management<br />
Asset management comprises the management of the client's funds conducted on the basis of the contract signed by the investor and the management company. An investor transfers his or her powers to the management company, which chooses a professional and effective investment strategy based on the client's aims and financial capability.<br />
The traders react to any fluctuations on the financial market by immediately correcting the investment strategy in order to achieve and maintain high profit levels for an investor.<br />
Asset management for our clients<br />
The reliability of cooperation with a professional investment company.<br />
No restrictions concerning the sum of the initial investment.<br />
Guaranteed profit rate acquired at specified periods of time.<br />
All decisions concerning the management of the acquired profits are made by the investor himself.  <br />
The management company works hard to increase the investor's income since the size of the brokerage received by it depends on the profit acquired by the client. <br />
Does this investment method suit you?<br />
Business development <br />
The main reason for investing money into something is the formation of an additional source of passive income. If a client chooses the right way of investing money, he or she will be able to enjoy a certain degree of freedom in the development of his or her main business. Having a predetermined regular income, you will be able to expand the influence of your company at the market, invest the acquired profits into the development of new solutions and products, and define the prospective growth taking into consideration the peculiar features of your own stabilization fund.  <br />
Personal aims<br />
By transferring a part of your funds to an asset management company, you will be able to figure out how you are going to use the acquired additional income for your own purposes. This sum used to be just a kind of stabilizer, but now you will be able to spend more money on recreation and unplanned purchases without increasing the size of the supply subtracted from your regular income.<br />
Increasing the assets<br />
By increasing the amount of funds transferred to an asset management company by means of acquired profits you will be increasing your own capital. At the same time the money doesn't just get accumulated - it keeps on working for you. Consequently, the larger is the invested sum, the more profit you get from it.<br />
The advantages of transferring free funds into asset management<br />
The ability to build up your own investment business.<br />
Freedom in the process of designing more ambitious development strategies.<br />
Guaranteed stability and substantial amount of profits.<br />
Additional funds that can be used in the realization of one's personal aims.<br />
Capital growth and steady increase of the active income. <br />
The advantages that we offer <br />
Individual approach and absolutely straight dealing with our clients. We strive towards close long-term business relationships that are able to bring mutual profits to our clients, partners, and ourselves. Guided by the willingness to achieve our common goals, we pay maximum attention to each of our investors. We value long-term relationships with our investors much higher than one-time transactions - that's why we keep on doing our best to give maximum confidence to our clients and ensure the perfect performance of our liabilities.<br />
Reliability. We minimize the risks taken by our clients by means of investment diversification and the utilizations of a specific investment strategy. All the investments that we manage get insured at the conditions that guarantee fullest protection of our clients' interests.<br />
Blameless reputation. During our history we have signed a lot of profitable contracts. Long years of successful operation at the international market have resulted in the establishment of our company's blameless reputation based on the professional operation of our staff as well as the highest quality of the provided services. <br />
Safe Investment Management Conception. Our work is based upon the principles; the effectiveness of which has been tested and proven in practice.<br />
Objective valuation of expectations.<br />
Detailed reports about the achieved results. <br />
Scrupulous risk management. <br />
Full correspondence of our activity to the current legislation. <br />
The willingness to find an appropriate solution for every particular problem.<br />
Creative approach towards the problems experienced by our clients. <br />
Aiming at the establishment of long-term business relationships with our clients.<br />
The clients working with Private Fund Management should be fully confident of the reliability and the potential profitability of their investment. Our employees will help you choose the most convenient and well-paying investment option for you after picking up the appropriate investment strategy and investment portfolio. <br />
Investment portfolios<br />
While choosing the appropriate investment means one will always have to look for the happy medium between two indices: profitability and possible risks. These indices are in direct relation to each other - the bigger is the potential profit, the bigger is the potential risk. It has to be noted that the concept of risk is getting less and less relevant these days since within the past seven years of our operation at the financial market none of our clients have ever received profits lower than those agreed upon during the process of signing the contract. We offer solutions able to help each of our customers to choose the investment means that is the most profitable for him or her in particular. <br />
What is an investment portfolio?<br />
An investment portfolio is the combination of assets that you invest your money into. The process of building up an investment portfolio is based upon the process of choosing securities. The main reason for creating a portfolio is pretty simple - if done correctly, it will allow you to supply your set of securities with such investment features (profitability and risk) that cannot be achieved by purchasing only stocks or bonds, for instance. Combination is the only key to creating a good investment portfolio.<br />
Peculiar features of different investment portfolios<br />
All investment portfolios are built up in accordance with one of the following strategies:<br />
The strategy aimed at the aggressive capital growth stimulation with high level of risk. Potential annual profitability of this strategy can be estimated at about 35%. This strategy is based upon the utilization of tools with a high level of risk: shares, futures, and options.<br />
The strategy aimed at low-risk investment and intended for steady capital growth (about 22% annually). Stocks can serve as an example of low-risk investment tools. </p>

<p>By combining high- and low-risk approaches in different proportions, the experts of Private Fund Management develop investment portfolios based on the requirements set by different clients. </p>
