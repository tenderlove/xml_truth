        <h2>Summary</h2>


	<p>This month&#8217;s meeting was a first: two speakers!</p>


	<p>Syed Rayhan, of Code71, started off the evening with an architectural overview of his company&#8217;s product: ScrumPad.  Utilizing Amazon Web Services, ScrumPad is implemented &#8220;in the cloud.&#8221;  He also covered scaling and performance enhancements.</p>


	<p>We finished off the night with Kevin Smith, of EngineYard, giving us a brief but engaging look into Erlang.  He covered the basics of the bizarre syntax, reliance on pattern matching, and the reuse of concepts within the language.</p>


	<p>It was great having both speakers.  However, they both had material that would have covered an entire meeting on their own.  At this point I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be scheduling more then one speaker per meeting.</p>


	<h2>Attendance</h2>


	<p>We had 13 people at this month&#8217;s meeting.  The second double-digit attendance. You guys Rock!  We even had three brand new faces in attendance.  Very encouraging.  Please, keep spreading the word.</p>


	<p>I would also encourage you to make suggestions on how we can serve your Ruby needs.  Remember we have the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/CVRuby">mailing list</a> and the <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/rubycodejam"><span class="caps">IRC</span> channel</a> in which to post your questions and suggestions.</p>

	<h2>Meeting Abstract</h2>


	<p>We&#8217;re pleased to have two speakers for this Month&#8217;s meeting.  Syed Rayhan, of Code71, will be talking about <strong>ScrumPad</strong>, a web-based Agile/Scrum project management tool.  Plus, Kevin Smith will be up from Raleigh to give us a look at <strong>Erlang</strong>.</p>


	<h3>ScrumPad</h3>


	<p>ScrumPad (http://www.scrumpad.com) is Web-based Agile/Scrum project management and collaboration tool. It was developed on Ruby on Rails as Software as a Service (SaaS). Recently, he migrated ScrumPad from Rails 1.2.x to Rails 2.x. It is deployed in the Amazon cloud (Amazon Web Services, a.k.a. <span class="caps">AWS</span>). <span class="caps">AWS</span> offers a set of IT infrastructure like compute power, storage, and other as a services. As a result, the cost of infrastructure truly becomes a variable cost. The business applications running on <span class="caps">AWS</span> can be dialed up and down to match its fluctuating load in real-time. ScrumPad is using Amzon&#8217;s <span class="caps">EC2</span>, S3, <span class="caps">EBS</span>, and <span class="caps">SQS</span>. He will share his experience using  Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Rails migration.</p>


	<h3>Erlang</h3>


	<p>The multicore future has arrived and now the only question is: how do we deal with it? Spend an hour learning about Erlang&#8212;the functional programming language designed for highly concurrent environments. You&#8217;ll get an introduction to Erlang&#8217;s major concepts, it&#8217;s syntax, and learn which companies are using Erlang today and what kinds of problems they&#8217;re solving.</p>


	<h2>Presenter Bios</h2>


	<h3>Syed Rayhan</h3>


	<p>After twelve years of designing multi-faceted IT solutions for financial services companies, Syed H. Rayhan, co-founder of Code71, is putting his skills to the test by leading the company to provide a comprehensive suite of development, maintenance, and support services to a growing list of clients.</p>


	<p>Syed holds an <span class="caps">MBA</span> from the University of North Carolina, Kenan-Flagler Business School, as well as, an MS in Computer Engineering from the University of Central Florida and an undergraduate degree from <span class="caps">BUET</span> (Bangladesh University of Engineering Technology) in Electrical &#38; Electronic Engineering. Syed is a member of the Scrum Alliance and is co-author of Enterprise Java with <span class="caps">UML</span> (pub. Wiley &#38; Sons). His current interests is building  in Agile fashion Enterprise 2.0 solutions running in the Cloud.</p>


	<h3>Kevin Smith</h3>

        <h2>Summary</h2>


	<p>Erik Hatcher, of Lucid Imagination, came all the way from Charlottesville to school us on some Solr and Lucene.  He even did some live coding!</p>


	<p>It seemed a number of people&#8217;s interest was piqued given the nature of their questions.  Even though not many people are currently using Solr, I feel after Erik&#8217;s talk they&#8217;re thinking about how easy it is to integrate into their app.</p>


	<h2>Attendance</h2>


	<p>Did we have the largest turn out?  Definitely for this year!  We had a total 17 people at tonight&#8217;s meeting; 7 from Cville (this includes Erik).  You guys Rock!  We had 6 brand new faces attend.  Definitely keep spreading the word.</p>


	<p>I would also encourage you to make suggestions on how we can serve your Ruby needs.

	<h2>Meeting Abstract</h2>


	<p>Solr brings enterprise-scale search to the masses, building upon the powerful Lucene search library.  Interacting with Solr through <span class="caps">HTTP</span> makes developing applications in any language or environment straightforward.  This talk will demonstrate Solr from the ground up: indexing data, searching it, faceting, highlighting, spellchecking and more.  After covering Solr fundamentals, and demonstrating its features live through the command-line and browser, we&#8217;ll delve into working with Solr through Ruby, using the solr-ruby library and also discussing the current state of the acts_as_solr ActiveRecord plugin and the work being done with the new RSolr (a solr-ruby refactoring replacement) project, and we&#8217;ll also see examples of Flare (a dusty RoR plugin) and other techniques for getting Solr integrated into your applications.  After all of the flashy cool stuff, we&#8217;ll discuss production considerations for deploying Solr for real such as scaling via replication and distributed search.</p>


	<h2>Solr for your Rails App</h2>


	<p>If you&#8217;re considering adding search capabilities to your Rails app, do yourself a favor:  come out and learn what Solr can do for your application.  There are a number of sites/apps using Solr in the &#8216;real world&#8217;.</p>


	<p>Come get your search on!</p>


	<h2>Presenter Bio</h2>


	<p>Erik Hatcher codes, writes, and speaks about all things Solr, a Lucene-powered search server.  He co-authored &#8220;Lucene in Action&#8221;, has spoken at numerous technical conferences and user groups around the world, and has consulted with many big name organizations.  Erik works for Lucid Imagination, a full-service Lucene/Solr shop.</p>

	<h2>Meeting Abstract</h2>


	<p>Continous Integration Automation should be a key part of your tools, especially in team environments.  Come learn a bit about about CI and a lot about CruiseControl.rb.  You&#8217;ll see how easy it is to get started, and some of the great integration of metrics tools such as Flog, Heckle, and RCov&#8230;  Don&#8217;t you want to say you flogged your code?</p>


	<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>


	<p>Come join us as we learn about Continuous Integration, why it&#8217;s important to your project, and a few of the options and supporting tools available to us Ruby Developers.  We have Eric Pugh, of Open Source Connections in Charlottesville, coming in to share his experience and expertise on CI.  Though I had heard of CruiseControl prior to working with Mr. Pugh, it was he that really sold me on the idea of CI and CruiseControl; that was back in the day when I was slinging Java code.</p>

        <h2>Parting Thoughts</h2>


	<p>As the year draws to a close we&#8217;d like to Thank all that have made this a wonderful year: Presenters, Sponsors, and most of all the Members.</p>


	<h3>Meetings</h3>


	<p>We look forward to the meetings as a time to see new faces and socialize with the awesome folks and hear about some cool technology, tools, or techniques.</p>


	<p>Though we try to same Ruby-centric, we&#8217;re not shy to learn about something new (or old, in the case of Smalltalk) that could make us better developers and help the community, at large.</p>


	<p>We have exciting meetings planned for 2009. Keep an eye on the website for information.  Is there a topic you&#8217;d like to
see?  Send your suggestions via the mailing list (http://groups.google.com/group/CVRuby).</p>


	<h3>Resources</h3>


	<p>Remember, when you have a Ruby question (or any technology for that matter) we have a lot of helpful people on the mailing list(http://groups.google.com/group/CVRuby) and in the #rubycodejam <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel.  Also, questions are welcomed at the meetings.</p>


	<p>Not only do we love the technology we enjoy helping people; we&#8217;ve been were you&#8217;re at.</p>


	<h3>Technologies</h3>


	<p>We&#8217;re reminded often how close to the bleeding edge we are here at <span class="caps">CVREG</span>.  What now seems old-hat to many of us, many more are just now learning about:  GitHub, Sinatra, iPhone Development, <span class="caps">TDD</span>/BDD.</p>


	<p>Just this year, we&#8217;ve had  two Smalltalk meetings; and hope to have more, especially when MagLev becomes available.</p>


	<h3>Future</h3>


	<p>2009, we feel, is going to be another wild and crazy ride.  Here&#8217;s to making 2009 another spectacular year for the <span class="caps">CVREG</span>.</p>


	<p>Have a wonderful and safe Holiday.</p>


	<p>The <span class="caps">CVREG</span> Steering Committee.</p>

        <p>
We have some exciting talks lined up, already, for next year.  We're always open to Topic suggestions; send them on in, via the mailing list is A-OK.</p>
<p>
So, let's see what's in store for the first quarter
<table>
<tr><th>Date</th><th>Topic</th><th>Speaker(s)</th></tr>
<tr>
 <td>13 Jan</td><td>Continuous Integration</td><td>Eric Pugh</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>10 Feb</td><td>Solr</td><td>Erik Hatcher</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>10 Mar</td><td>Erlang</td><td>Kevin Smith</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>10 Mar</td><td>Scrum Pad</td><td>Syed Rayhan</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
We're hoping to get Syed to come out in March since illness caused us to cancel the November meeting.</p>
<p>
We know schedules can change last minute and we'll do our best to keep everyone informed of any changes.  However, plan to attend and bring your questions.</p>

        <div class="post-body">
        <p>Please join us on 9 Dec to hear Jim Van Fleet, <span class="caps">CVREG</span> creator, talk about maintaining one&#8217;s balance in an environment where competing factors can easily overwhelm.</p>


 Abstract 

	<p>Being a developer is all about balance.  Balancing code quality, testing coverage, business and client needs, performance in production, and working with other&#8217;s code in an environment of rapid and significant change is why we get paid the big bucks.  But what happens when that balance is upset?</p>


 Bio 

	<p>Jim Van Fleet, Community Developer from TradeKing, will take a look at this question and offer some tips to help you keep your project on the right track to deliver a successful launch during development so that you aren&#8217;t scrambling when that first wave of new users hits.</p>


 Open Mic 

	<p>After Jim&#8217;s presentation I&#8217;d like to open the meeting to you.  Let us know how your Ruby year progressed.</p>


 Meeting Details 

	<p>Can be found on Upcoming.com: <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1403823/">http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1403823/</a></p>
