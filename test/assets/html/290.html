          Take another look at the cover of this magazine. The little girl on 
          the left is me in November 1960, walking up the steps of William Frantz 
          Public School in New Orleans, the first black student at the formerly 
          all-white elementary school. That's me now, on the right, married, a 
          mother of four. Forty years separate those pictures.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forty years that brought 
          incredible change in our country, forged in the crucible of the civil 
          rights movement and the battle to end segregation. Forty years that 
          changed me as well.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          I was born in Mississippi in 1954, the oldest child of Abon and Lucille 
          Bridges. That year the United States handed down its landmark decision 
          ordering the integration of public schools. Not that I knew anything 
          about school at the time. What I knew and loved was growing up on the 
          farm my paternal grandparents sharecropped.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a very hard life, 
          though. My parents heard there were better opportunities in the city. 
          We moved to New Orleans, where my father found work as a service station 
          attendant, and my mother took night jobs to help support our growing 
          family.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I got a bit older, my 
          job was to keep an eye on my younger brothers and sister, which wasn't 
          too difficult. Except for church and the long walk to the all-black 
          school where I went to kindergarten, our world didn't extend beyond 
          our block. But that was all about to change.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under federal court order, 
          New Orleans public schools were finally forced to desegregate. In the 
          spring of 1960 I took a test, along with other black kindergarteners 
          in the city, to see who would go to an integrated school come September. 
          That summer my parents learned I'd passed the test and had been selected 
          to start first grade at William Frantz Public School.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother was all for it. 
          My father wasn't. &quot;We're just asking for trouble,&quot; he said. 
          He thought things weren't going to change, and blacks and whites would 
          never be treated as equals. Mama thought I would have an opportunity 
          to get a better education if I went to the new school - and a chance 
          for a good job later in life. My parents argued about it and prayed 
          about it. Eventually my mother convinced my father that despite the 
          risks, they had to take this step forward, not just for their own children, 
          but for all black children.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A federal judge decreed that 
          Monday, November 14, 1960 would be the day black children in New Orleans 
          would go to school with white children. There were six of us chosen 
          to integrate the city's public school system. Two decided to stay in 
          their old schools. The other three were assigned to McDonough. I would 
          be going to William Frantz alone.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The morning of November 14 
          federal marshals drove my mother and me the five blocks to William Frantz. 
          In the car one of the men explained that when we arrived at the school 
          two marshals would walk in front of us an two behind, so we'd be protected 
          on both sides.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That reminded me of what 
          Mama had taught us about God, that he is always there to protect us. 
          &quot;Ruby Nell,&quot; she said as we pulled up to my new school, &quot;don't 
          be afraid. There might be some people upset outside, but I'll be with 
          you.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, people shouted 
          and shook their fist when we got out of the car, but to me it wasn't 
          any noisier than Mardi Gras, I held my mother's hand and followed the 
          marshals through the crowd, up the steps into the school.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We spent that whole day sitting 
          in the principal's office. Through the window, I saw white parents pointing 
          at us and yelling, then rushing their children out of the school. In 
          the uproar I never got to my classroom.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The marshals drove my mother 
          and me to school again the next day. I tried not to pay attention to 
          the mob. Someone had a black doll in a coffin, and that scared me more 
          than the nasty things people screamed at us.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A young white woman met us 
          inside the building. She smiled at me. &quot;Good morning, Ruby Nell,&quot; 
          she said, just like Mama except with what I later learned was a Boston 
          accent. &quot;Welcome, I'm your new teacher, Mrs. Henry.&quot; She seemed 
          nice, but I wasn't sure how to feel about her. I'd never been taught 
          by a white teacher before.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Henry took my mother 
          and me to her second-floor classroom. All the desks were empty and she 
          asked me to choose a seat. I picked one up front, and Mrs. Henry started 
          teaching me the letters of the alphabet.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning my mother 
          told me she couldn't go to school with me. She had to work and look 
          after my brothers and sister. &quot;The marshals will take good care 
          of you, Ruby Nell,&quot; Mama assured me. &quot;Remember, if you get 
          afraid, say your prayers. You can pray to God anytime, anywhere. He 
          will always hear you.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was how I started praying 
          on the way to school. The things people yelled at me didn't seem to 
          touch me. Prayer was my protection. After walking up the steps past 
          the angry crowd, though, I was glad to see Mrs. Henry. She gave me a 
          hug, and she sat right by my side instead of at the big teacher's desk 
          in the front of the room. Day after day, it was just Mrs. Henry and 
          me, working on my lessons.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Militant segregationists, 
          as the news called them, took to the streets in protest, and riots erupted 
          all over the city. My parents shielded me as best they could, but I 
          knew problems had come to our family because I was going to the white 
          school. My father was fired from his job. The white owners of a grocery 
          store told us not to shop there anymore. Even my grandparents in Mississippi 
          suffered. The owner of the land they'd sharecropped for 25 years said 
          everyone knew it was their granddaughter causing trouble in New Orleans, 
          and asked them to move.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, there were 
          a few white families who braved the protests and kept their children 
          in school. But they weren't in my class, so I didn't see them. People 
          from around the country who'd heard about me on the news sent letters 
          and donations. A neighbor gave my dad a job painting houses. Other folks 
          baby-sat for us, watched our house to keep away troublemakers, even 
          walked behind the marshal's car on my way to school. My family couldn't 
          have made it without our friends' and neighbors' help.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And me, I couldn't have gotten 
          through that year without Mrs. Henry. Sitting next to her in our classroom, 
          just the two of us, I was able to forget the world outside. She made 
          school fun. We did everything together. I couldn't go out in the schoolyard 
          for recess, so right in that room we played games and for exercise we 
          did jumping jacks to music.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember her explaining 
          integration to me and why some people were against it. &quot;It's not 
          easy for people to change once they have gotten used to living a certain 
          way,&quot; Mrs. Henry said. &quot;Some of them don't know any better 
          and they're afraid. But not everyone is like that.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though I was only six, 
          I knew what she meant. The people I passed every morning as I walked 
          up the schools steps were full of hate. They were white, but so was 
          my teacher, who couldn't have been more different from them. She was 
          one of the most loving people I had ever known. The greatest lesson 
          I learned that year in Mrs. Henry's class was the lesson Dr. Martin 
          Luther King Jr., tried to teach us all. Never judge people by the color 
          of their skin. God makes each of us unique in ways that go much deeper. 
          From her window, Mrs. Henry always watched me walk into school. One 
          morning when I got to our classroom, she said she'd been surprised to 
          see me talk to the mob. &quot;I saw your lips moving,&quot; she said, 
          &quot;but I couldn't make out what you were saying to those people.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn't talking to them,&quot; 
          I told her. &quot;I was praying for them.&quot; Usually I prayed in 
          the car on the way to school, but that day I'd forgotten until I was 
          in the crowd. Please be with me, I'd asked God, and be with those people 
          too. Forgive them because they don't know what they're doing.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Ruby Nell, you are 
          truly someone special,&quot; Mrs. Henry whispered, giving me an even 
          bigger hug than usual. She had this look on her face like my mother 
          would get when I'd done something to make her proud.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another person who helped 
          me was Dr. Robert Coles, a child psychiatrist who happened to see me 
          being escorted through the crowd outside my school. Dr. Coles volunteered 
          to work with me through this ordeal. Soon he was coming to our house 
          every week to talk with me about how I was doing in school.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Really, I was doing fine. 
          I was always with people who wanted the best for me: my family, friends, 
          and in school, my teacher. The more time I spent with Mrs. Henry, the 
          more I grew to love her. I wanted to be like her. Soon, without realizing 
          it, I had picked up her Boston accent.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither of us missed a single 
          day of school that year. The crowd outside dwindled to just a few protestors, 
          and before I knew it, it was June. For me, first grade ended much more 
          quietly than it began. I said good-bye to Mrs. Henry, fully expecting 
          her to be my teacher again in the fall.</font>
        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 13; margin-right: 23"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF" size="1">But 
          when I went back to school in September, everything was different. There 
          were no marshals, no protestors. There were other kids - even some other 
          black students - in my second-grade class. And Mrs. Henry was gone. 
          I was devastated. Years later I found out she hadn't been invited to 
          return to William Frantz, and she and her husband had moved back to 
          Boston. It was almost as if that first year of school integration had 
          never happened. No one talked about it. Everyone seemed to have put 
          that difficult time behind them.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, I did the 
          same. I finished grade school at William Frantz and graduated from an 
          integrated high school, went to business school and studied travel and 
          tourism. For 15 years I worked as a travel agent. Eventually I married 
          and threw myself into raising four sons in the city I grew up in.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't give much thought 
          to the events of my childhood until my youngest brother died in 1993. 
          For a time, I looked after his daughters. They happened to be students 
          at William Frantz, and when I took them there every morning, I was literally 
          walking into my past, into the same school that I'd help integrate years 
          earlier.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I began volunteering three 
          days a week at William Frantz, working as a liaison between parents 
          and the school. Still, I had the feeling God had brought me back in 
          touch with my past for something beyond that. I struggled with it for 
          a while. Finally I got on my knees and prayed, Lord, whatever it is 
          I'm supposed to be doing, you'll have to show me.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not long after that, a reporter 
          called the school. The psychiatrist Robert Coles had written a children's 
          book, The Story of Ruby Bridges; now everyone wanted to know what had 
          happened to the little girl in the Norman Rockwell painting (See Picture 
          Gallery) that had appeared in Look magazine. No one expected to find 
          me back at William Frantz. Dr. Coles had often written about me, but 
          this was the first book intended for children. To me it was God's way 
          of keeping my story alive until I was able to tell it myself.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the best parts of 
          the story is that I was finally reunited with my favorite teacher, Barbara 
          Henry. She reached me through the publisher of Dr. Coles's book, and 
          in 1995 we saw each other in person for the first time in more than 
          three decades. The second she laid eyes on me, she cried, &quot;Ruby 
          Nell!&quot; No one had called me that since I was a little girl. Then 
          we were hugging each other, just like we used to every morning in first 
          grade.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't realize how much 
          I had picked up from Mrs. Henry (I still have a hard time calling her 
          anything else) - not only her Boston accent, but her mannerism too, 
          such as how she tilts her head and gestures her hands when she talks. 
          She showed me a tiny, dog-eared photo of me with my front teeth missing 
          that she'd kept all these years. &quot;I used to look at that picture 
          and wonder how you were,&quot; she said. &quot;I told my kids about 
          you so often you were like part of my family.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have stayed a part of 
          each other's lives ever since. It turns out that because of what I went 
          through on the front lines of the battle for school integration, people 
          recognize my name and are eager to hear what I have to say about racism 
          and education today. I speak to groups around the country, and when 
          I visit schools, Mrs. Henry often comes with me. We tell kids our story 
          and talk about the lessons of the past and how we can still learn from 
          them today - especially that every child is a unique human being fashioned 
          by God.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tell them that another 
          important thing I learned in first grade is that schools can be a place 
          to bring people together - kids of all races and backgrounds. That's 
          the work I focus on now, connecting our children through their schools. 
          It's my way of continuing what God set in motion 40 years ago when he 
          led me up the steps of William Frantz Public School and into a new world 
          with my teacher, Mrs. Henry - a world that under his protection has 
          reached far beyond just the two of us in that classroom.<br>
