  <p align="left">Sapphire gemstone exists in all the shades of color, such as, 
    blue pink yellow white green, fancy. The oldest Saphire mines are situated 
    in Ceylon, today called Sri Lanka. The expert recognizes Ceylon sapphires 
    from the luminosity and brilliance of their light to medium blue colour. Normally, 
    sapphires come from Thailand or Australia.</p>
  <p align="left">Sapphires are birthstone September. They are suitable to set 
    with diamond ring earring and bracelet. There a lot of saphire minding, but 
    height quality saphire come from Thailand, Burma and Brazil.Australia. Yellow 
    sapphire is also birthstone for whom was born in September. There are verity 
    of tone color. The major element of color is iron. High quality yellow saphire 
    come from Sri Lanka, Australia and Thailand. Ceylon pink sapphire is alos 
    popular. they have the same as material with rubies (corundum), but we will 
    call ruby when the color stone is pure red. Sri Lanka produces many petty 
    shade of saphire they are called ceylon saphire. There are also a lot of mining

  <p align="left">Ruby stone has been considered on the most valuable gemstones, 
    because they are wonderful colour, excellent hardness and overwhelming brilliance. 
    The most important, it is an rare gemstones. Ruby is the red variety of the 
    corundum mineral, one of the hardest minerals on Earth which also includes 
    Sapphires. Burma ruby stone is the most popular of color for making jewelry. 
    They are usually set with diamond ring, pendant and earring. Thailand rubies 
    is called Siam ruby. </p>
  <p align="left">Some Rubies show a wonderful silky shine, the so-called &quot;silk” 
    of the Ruby. The reason for this phenomenon are finest rutilum needles. And 
    now and then we will come across one of the very scarce Star Rubies. If such 
    Rubies are cut as half-dome shaped cabochons, this will result in six-ray 
    stars which seem to magically glide across the surface of the moving stones. 
    Star Rubies are expensive rarities Their value is assessed according to beauty 
    and attractive colour, while transparency is secondary. Fine Star Rubies, 
    however, should always display rays which are completely shaped including 
    the rounding, and the stars should be situated right in the centre.<br>
