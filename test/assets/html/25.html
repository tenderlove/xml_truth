<p></p>
<p>Currently there's quite a debate raging over the relative merits
	of Groovy and JRuby as scripting languages running on the Java
	virtual machine. Curious minds want to know - which of these
	languages will win this upcoming language war? People want to know
	which language to pick for a project, or which language to commit to
	learn.</p><p>Perhaps the first thing to point out is that it's perhaps rather
	unfair to see this as a race between these particular two
	horses. Scripting has been available on the JVM for a long
	time. Jython, a Java implementation of Python, has been around for
	several years. There's plenty of other, more obscure languages,
	which I daren't mention for fear of offending all the ones I miss out.</p><p>JRuby has got a lot of attention due to the attention of the Ruby
	language generally - attention particularly ignited by the interest
	around Rails. We've seen a sharp spike of interest around Ruby and
	Rails work at ThoughtWorks, and JRuby adds an extra dimension since
	it allows people to deploy Rails applications using their existing
	Java infrastructure.</p><p>Groovy gets its attention because it, more than any other
	language, is designed to work seamlessly with the JVM, and got a lot
	of attention from an early JSR.</p><p>Personally I'd dropped Groovy from my radar a couple of years ago
	when its development seemed to bog down. With its 1.0 release and
	further interesting positive vibes from some of my colleagues I've
	started to pay attention again.</p><p>Lets begin by talking about similarities. Both JRuby and Groovy
	(and indeed Jython) are modern OO scripting languages. They combine
	the well-chosen terseness of scripting languages with good solid
	structures for building larger programs. As such they are suitable
	both for classical scripting and for writing larger programs. Both
	are comfortable with dynamic type checking, although Groovy does
	offer some static facilities too. Both support <a href = 'Closures.html'>Closures</a>
	which are an important feature for the greater expressiveness that
	people want from this kind of language.</p><p>The biggest difference between them is their broader platform
	philosophy. Groovy is designed to be a scripting language for
	Java. As much as possible its syntax tries to match the equivalent
	in Java. (Including such ugly things as the default fall-through in
	switch statements.) It also works with Java's class library
	directly, although it dynamically adds many methods to Java's
	classes, vital in order to make use of things like closures.</p><p>JRuby, however, is a Java implementation of the Ruby
	<i>platform</i>. Ruby can run directly on mainstream operating systems with
	a C runtime, and is starting to run on .NET's CLR. When you
	program in JRuby you primarily use Ruby's libraries which are
	implemented in Java, and may also use Java's libraries at your
	discretion. If you stick to Ruby's libraries, or at least wrap any
	foreign elements, you can run Ruby programs on the C, Java, or (in
	time) .NET
	runtimes. So you can use JRuby to both run Ruby programs on the JVM
	and as a language for scripting the JVM.</p><p>One of the big differences between JRuby and Jython is around the
	libraries. One of the tricky aspects of porting this kind of
	scripting language to the JVM is that these languages are usually
	closely intertwined with libraries implemented in C. Porting these
	libraries to Java involves rewriting the libraries in Java. Jython
	didn't do much of this, as a result many Python apps can't run in
	Jython. However the JRuby implementers decided from early on that their
	goal was to run Rails apps, as a result many libraries including all
	the Ruby standard libraries needed to be ported.</p><p>The fact that JRuby is a Ruby platform on the JVM means that in
  JRuby you have two kinds of objects - JRuby objects and Java
  objects. Although there are ways for the two to talk to each other
  and to convert there is a difference. There are times when you need
  to know whether you're dealing with a Java string or a JRuby
  string. With Groovy you don't have that boundary, there are just
  Java objects.</p><p>It's too early, or rather too difficult, to say if one language
	will win out. Both are pretty young, only just finding their feet on
	the JVM. On a more personal level, your choice has a lot to do with what
	you expect to do with it. If you are only interested in running on
	the JVM, then Groovy could well be the easier choice. You are
	working directly with Java's library and object model, and the syntax
	requires less getting used to. A strong reason to prefer Ruby is the
	fact that it lives in multiple implementations. Ruby is a tool you
	can use in a lot of other places. As a long time Rubyist, there's
	not much incentive for me personally to get heavily into Groovy,
	even though I actually like the language a lot from what I've seen
	of it.</p><p>Rails is an important factor. The Java world is hardly
	lacking in web frameworks, but Rails is widely liked by those who've
	used it. I've not got many reports yet about Grails (the Groovy
	knock-off) so can't give a firm opinion on that. But I can imagine
	that the ability to deploy web apps with Rails could be a major
	factor in making JRuby popular. Something else to look at is the
	growth of RSpec as a new spin on testing environments.</p><p>With any platform it's as important to consider the people
involved in the community as much as any technical factors. Good people
can overcome technical weaknesses quickly and a vibrant community is a
potent source for big innovations. <a href = 'RubyPeople.html'>RubyPeople</a> have formed
a particularly strong community, which has already spawned things like
Rails, Rake, and Rspec. </p><p>Will either matter to Java? After all Jython's been around for a
	long time without making a huge impact on the JVM. Tool support is
	frankly pathetic for any of these languages when you compare it to
	what you have for Java at the moment.</p><p>I think we're actually at an inflection point with Java. Until
recently the Java cry was One VM and <a href = 'OneLanguage.html'>OneLanguage</a>. (As
opposed to the CLR which started with the cry of one VM and many
languages - providing
they're C# or VB.) This seems to be changing as people realize the
limitations of Java and begin to seek out different capabilities. It's
likely the future will see multiple languages closely integrated
within the JVM.</p><p>There are plenty of people who dislike the hype around Rails and
	Ruby. But even if you dislike Ruby, the hype has led to a resurgence
	of interest in new languages. I doubt if the interest in Groovy
	would be anywhere near as great as it is if it wasn't for this hype,
	nor would Jython be awaking from its slumbers. The ruby/rails hype
	has also generated interest in other exotic JVM languages. The
	really nice thing here is that the JRuby people have been
	encouraging their dynamic rivals - recognizing that the point
	here is to encourage multi-lingual inter-operability and innovation.</p><hr></hr></td>

<p><b>Update:</b> Recently we've seen some very encourging signs coming out
  of Redmond. In particular, <a href = 'http://www.iunknown.com/2007/07/a-first-look-at.html'>IronRuby</a> will be hosted on RubyForge with
  what looks like a very permissive licence - Ola <a href = 'http://ola-bini.blogspot.com/2007/07/ironruby-scoop.html'>approves</a>.</p><p>At <a href = 'RailsConf2007.html'>RailsConf2007</a> there was a lot of excitement over JRuby. This small
  team had taken a moribund project and turned it into what looks like
  a first class implementation of the Ruby platform on the JVM. They
  got a lot of cheers and deserved them all.</p><p>So with JRuby pretty much here, the spotlight moves onto the other
	common managed code runtime - .NET. Microsoft's intentions for Ruby
	are currently much less clear. They have announced Ruby as a
	language for scripting Silverlight - but that still leaves a lot of
	open questions. Is this a full implementation of the ruby language,
	or is some form of Ruby++ - an enhanced subset of Ruby?</p><p>JRuby serves two distinct but complementary purposes. On the one
  hand it's a powerful scripting language for the JVM, allowing you to
  weave a dynamic language into a Java application. It's second
  purpose is an implementation of the Ruby platform in the JVM, which
  allows a Ruby application, in particular a Ruby on Rails
  application, to run on the JVM just as well as it runs on the MRI
  (Matz's Ruby Interpreter, the current C runtime). </p><p>The big question for Microsoft's "Iron Ruby" is how compatible will it be? Will
it be a full implementation on the CLR? All the signals I hear tell me
that John Lam, the main force behind Iron Ruby, is determined to get a
fully compatible implementation. However this may be very difficult to
do as things stand. Soon-to-be-ThoughtWorker Ola Bini, a JRuby
committer,  reckons that it's almost impossible to figure out how to
implement a Ruby runtime without looking at source code of the MRI - but
Microsoft imposes drastic limitations on its employees' ability to
download open source software, let alone look at the source. The
open-source community does much of its communication through source
code - so this makes collaboration with an open-source community very
difficult.</p><p>Overshadowing this, of course, is Microsoft's historically difficult
	relationship with the open source world. In the past Microsoft has
	gone out of its way to vilify and threaten the open source
	community. In recent years things have improved, but there's a real
	question about Microsoft's core intentions. The recent patent
	threats are seen by many as proof that Microsoft is still intent on
	fighting open source to the death.</p><p>Unlike most other technology companies, Microsoft has struggled
to find a way to co-exist with the open source world. It is harder for
Microsoft - unlike Sun, Apple, or IBM they are overwhelmingly a
software company. Open source projects like Linux, GNU, and Open
Office are directly competing with Microsoft's crown jewels. However
I've never felt that declaring war on open-source, trying to stamp it
out, was a viable long-term solution. Open-source is here to stay, the
question is how to accommodate  it. </p><p>With Ruby Microsoft is in a different position to the more
visible death match. Ruby doesn't compete with the core revenue
generators in Microsoft's line up.  What's more there is a real desire
in the Ruby community to co-operate with Microsoft. Most people I
talked to at RailsConf were very keen to see a full
range of support for Ruby on Microsoft - and there were a lot of
creative ideas floating around on how we could try to come with an
approach that could make it work. The overwhelming sense I heard in
the community was not "Ruby will kill evil Microsoft" but "how can we
overcome the problems to get Ruby on Microsoft."</p><p>As Chris Sells pointed out, we do have to consider the question
"what's in this for Microsoft". I see a couple of reasons. First off
is the role of .NET and Windows in the data center. If Microsoft
doesn't support the Ruby platform, it runs the risk of people moving
away from .NET (and Windows) on server farms if Ruby on Rails becomes
successful.</p><p>Another reason is people. Microsoft doesn't like to acknowledge
this in public, but there is a real concern that
<a href = 'AlphaGeek.html'>AlphaGeek</a>s are <a href = 'http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IsMicrosoftLosingTheAlphaGeeks.aspx'>moving away</a> from the Microsoft platform.
There's a growing sense that Microsoft's vision is armies of Morts in
command-and-control organizations. There often seems to be outright
discouragement of tools to enable talented enterprise developers, or
of agile development processes. </p><p>A few years ago my (limited) contacts in Redmond told me that
	they were seeing a real drift of technical leaders away from
	the Windows platform. More recently these signs seem to be increasing. Reading
	the 'softie part of my blogroll I got a sense of real disillusionment
	amongst people who have been long-time Microsoft
	supporters. Agile-oriented developers have been frustrated with the
	direction of Microsoft tools. Microsoft conferences barely
	mentioning agile processes, leaning much more to waterfall
	approaches. The tools, with their rigid role-separations, actively
	discourage the blurry boundaries that agilists prefer.</p><p>At RailsConf, Tim Bray contended that the key decisions on
	technology are made by the programming community. I partly agree
	with this. The reason we have so much bloatware in IT is because IT
	purchasing decisions are usually made on golf courses by people who
	have lost meaningful contact with the realities of software
	development. However golf-course decisions may dominate the
	short-term, but as time rolls on I think Tim's contention is
	true. So losing the alpha geeks may not matter this year or next, but will
	inexorably harm Microsoft over time.</p><p>Indeed it's already past next year for Microsoft. We've seen a
noticeable drop-off in interest from our clients for Microsoft
projects, particularly in the US. In Australia, .NET hasn't got any
foothold at all amongst our clients. I'm not sure what to make of this
data. We aren't so big to be a statistically valid sample on our own.
But it's a useful data point nonetheless particularly since we like to
think our clients are the "alpha IT shops". </p><p>Perhaps more significant is the story within ThoughtWorks. When
.NET appeared there was a lot of interest in the platform. Many people
were pleased to see a strong competitor to the Java platform and were
keen to get involved on .NET projects. Yet over the last year or so
there's been a big turn away from .NET. This is despite the fact that
there is some really interesting things coming out of Redmond. Mike
Two is very keen on the windows workflow tools, I've been very
impressed by Linq and other language developments. But the general
view of Microsoft technologies is a loud yawn. This is important
because, as Tim O'Reilly believes, the alpha geeks point to what
everyone else will be doing in a few years time. And the crucial point
is that the attitude to Microsoft isn't hatred (a common attitude
amongst many geeks) but boredom. This is what Paul Graham means when
he says that <a href = 'http://www.paulgraham.com/microsoft.html'>Microsoft is dead</a> because it's no longer dangerous.</p><p>The attitude to open-source is a large part of this problem. When
Java appeared there were yawning gaps in its portfolio, and worse some
dreadful standard tools in its API (visions of Entity Beans spring to mind).
Those gaps and bad ideas were fixed by the open-source community. Ant
gave us a build tool, EJB was displaced by Spring and Hibernate. .NET
has also got its gaps, and again the open source community has stepped
up to fill them. Yet Microsoft refuses to collaborate with these
efforts, even seems to go out of its way to undermine them. I was
particularly sickened by Microsoft's reaction to <a href = 'http://nunit.com'>NUnit</a> - an excellent
XUnit testing tool, elements of whose design were lauded by Anders
Hejlsberg at OOPSLA. Microsoft ended not just bringing out a
competitive library, but deliberately making it incompatible. That's
not the kind of reaction that encourages people to invest their time
in the platform.</p><p>To be fair, that debacle was a couple of years ago. Actions like
	hiring Jim Hugunin and John Lam have helped counter that
	impression. Technologists like Chris Sells, Don Box, and Jim Newkirk
	are working to make Microsoft are a more open environment. But like
	any large organization, Microsoft is full of contradictory forces
	and we don't know which ones will prevail. </p><p>My colleague John Kordyback pointed out that at the heart of all
this is realizing that Ruby is not Yet Another .NET Language but a
whole community and attitude to software development. Ruby is a
community where open source, agile thinking, and lightweight solutions
are deeply ingrained values. He says a common problem in Redmond is
that "They ask me 'Why is this language important' rather than 'Why is
this <i>thinking</i> important?'"
</p><p>So what I see for Ruby and Microsoft is an opportunity. The Ruby
community seems eager to work with Microsoft. This provides an
opportunity for Redmond to figure out how to deal with the problems of
working with open source and for this effort to serve as an exemplar
for future collaboration. A first class implementation of the full
Ruby platform on .NET would be a wonderful product of this
collaboration. Perhaps an even better result would be for this work to
serve as  an example of how Microsoft can collaborate with a community
that's centered on openness and agility; an example that can be a
springboard for further spreading of attitudes that can further help
programmers and their customers throughout the Microsoft world.</p><p>There's been quite a few reactions to this (see <a href = 'http://technorati.com/search/http://martinfowler.com/bliki/RubyMicrosoft.html'>Technorati</a> for a

<p>I don't go to as many conferences as I used to, but the advantage
  of that is that I have time to go to ones that take my fancy. I've
  long had a particular fondness for the Ruby community, so I turned
  up as an attendee at this year's RailsConf.</p>
<div class = 'photo' style = 'width: 240px'><a href = 'http://www.flickr.com/photos/x180/503554396'><img src = 'chadKilmer.jpg' height = '160px' width = '240px'></img></a>
<p>Chad Fowler and
  Rich Kilmer introduced
the conference. Chad shares my name but I don't share his ukulele skills.</p>
</div>
<p>With a young technology there's lots of new and important pieces
	appearing, but for me the  most important of these is
	<a href = 'http://jruby.codehaus.org/'>JRuby</a>. Now in its final cycle of release candidates, JRuby offers a
	full implementation of the Ruby Platform on the Java JVM, as well as
	providing a scripting language for the JVM. For what we do at
	ThoughtWorks, and for many Ruby/Rails developers this matters a
	great deal even if you never "include java". </p><p>One of the biggest issues our Ruby teams run into is
	deployment. Getting a ruby app into production involves a whole
	bunch of new technologies, and data centers tend to be conservative
	on this kind of thing. Our <a href = 'http://studios.thoughtworks.com/rubyworks'>RubyWorks</a> stack tries to simplify this,
	but JRuby offers the choice of just deploying into a Java container,
	turning a Rails app into an easily deployed war file. I think this
	will make Ruby on Rails a much more viable choice in lots of
	enterprise environments.</p><p>JRuby's maturity on the JDK raised the obvious question of what
will happen with the other popular managed runtime. Signals from
Microsoft were faint and unclear. It was good to see notable
Microsoft-oriented geeks
<a href = 'http://www.hanselman.com/blog/'>Scott Hanselman</a> and <a href = 'http://www.sellsbrothers.com/'>Chris Sells</a> at the show, even
if when I saw Chris Sells it felt like being in an arena. What I like
is that there is  a real desire within the ruby community to
collaborate with Microsoft rather than  the usual competition and
Redmond-bashing.</p><p>Indeed the overwhelming impression I got at RailsConf was a sense
	of industry-changing mission. At last year's conference my sense was
	that of a community delighted and rather stunned by its success. My
	iconic image was DHH as Neo of the Matrix, breaking the rules of
	enterprise software and reveling in the success.</p><p>This year my sense is that this morphed into something much more
important. Success is not just being an outbreak of sanity in the IT
world, but actually leading that world. There seems an excellent
chance that Ruby and Rails could become a significant platform for IT
develop over the next few years. We're already seeing signs of this at
ThoughtWorks - 40% of our new business this year in the US is Ruby
work.</p><p>Unlike previous platforms, this one isn't controlled or even
	dominated by vendors. Ruby is a community effort. I've been hoping
	for a long time that one of the LAMP technologies would break through
	into corporate IT, and it looks like Ruby could well do it.</p><p>Corporate IT is dominated by bloatware. Time and time again we
	have to deal with expensive software purchased on golf-courses that
	just get in our way while sucking funds and development
	hours. Technologies that make it harder for programmers to do what
	they like to do best - make a difference for the businesses they are
	supporting. (This week's memorable tale was of a large company
	that spent eight million dollars on an enterprise-wide version control
	system that couldn't branch properly.)</p><p>My hope that with a platform that's controlled by a community
	we'll see a platform that focuses on simplicity - finding the key
	things that need to be done and doing them in a way enables
	programmers to provide their best. </p>

<p>Michael
  Koziarski and Jamis Buck describing the Rails Way - establishing the
  good style which lies deep in the Ruby community.</p>
</div>
<p>It's helped by the fact that the ruby community has formed around
	the best ideas of the OO and Extreme Programming
	communities. Listening to the keynote of <a href = 'http://therailsway.com/'>Jamis Buck and Michael Koziarski</a> I was
	delighted to reflect on the thought that they were right there in
	the values of Ward, Kent, and all the other people who've been
	advocating clean code, well-factored object-oriented design, and
	testability. These ideas have made a great impact on many other
	technological communities, but in Ruby-land they are the orthodoxy.</p><p>Throughout the conference there was a sense that we are at an inflection-point in our
	industry, a key technological shift that promotes a new major
	platform. Listening and reading about JavaOne I got the sense that
	a big shift had happened there, people no longer focusing on Java
	the language but on Java the JVM, replacing one language with
	multiple languages closely collaborating. </p><p>A particularly fascinating thing about the Ruby community is the
	diversity of ages of people in it. Not just do you have the young
	paradigm breakers like DHH and the core team, you also have the, ahem,
	rather more seasoned campaigners like PragDave and the RubyCentral
	triumvirate. The important thing is that there's a lot of respect
	and collaboration across this generation gap. There isn't the wall
	between the  old
	farts and the loud teenagers that you often get, instead a real
	appreciation for what both groups have to offer.</p><p>Not that all is good, however. There is a marked lack of women in
the ruby community which, apart from the fact that we're missing out
on some serious talent, probably is a sign of  other problems within the
community. The <a href = 'http://www.devchix.com/'>DevChix</a> group was
pretty active in looking for ways to try to correct this  and I

problems.</p><p>A couple of years ago I wrote about the impressions people had

	that had changed for the worse. Both the ruby lists and particularly
	the rails lists had tended more towards the sad Internet mean. In
	his opening keynote Chad Fowler said that the rails community had a
	reputation as "a bunch of arrogant bastards" and I cringed as an,
	admittedly small, group raised a triumphant cheer. </p><p>What pleased me was, that starting with Chad, there was a strong push
from the ruby leadership to try and change this. A theme that came
from several talks was that our community had an opportunity to try to
lead the software profession away from this tar-pit of
<a href = 'NetNastiness.html'>NetNastiness</a> and lack of diversity, to create a community
that really welcomed many types of people into a nurturing and pleasant
environment. I've been sick of the tone of geek discussion for many
years and if the Ruby community could really show a direction to lift
us out of this quagmire, this would delight me even more than all of
the other prizes that glitter in front of us.</p><p><i>(Photos courtesy <a href = 'http://blog.duncandavidson.com/'>James Duncan Davidson</a>.)</i></p><hr></hr></td>

<td colspan = '4'>
<p></p>
<p>In the newly formed Rails community, the word 'enterprise' is
	becoming a dirty word. For many people the Rails framework, with its
	aggressive simplicity, is the antithesis of over-complex
	<a href = 'http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2006/03/its-enterprisey.html'>'enterprisey'</a> frameworks.</p><p>At the recent <a href = 'http://www.railsconf.org/'>RailsConf</a>,
	<a href = 'http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi'>PragDave</a>'s
	opening <a href = 'http://blog.scribestudio.com/articles/2006/06/30/railsconf-2006-keynote-series-dave-thomas'>keynote</a> highlighted a
	bunch of unsolved issues with Rails, several of which involved
	dealing with some of these enterprisey concerns. An example of this
	was his call for support of more
	varied database structures, such as having compound primary keys.</p><p><a href = 'http://www.loudthinking.com/'>DHH</a>'s response to this could not have been a more emphatic
	refusal. With a clever visual manipulation of his recent wired
	cover, DHH projected himself as the <a href = 'http://imdb.com/title/tt0133093/'>Neo</a> of the software world,
	forcefully proclaiming himself to be in a better place, and telling
	the enterprise world that they need to join him, not the other way
	around. Applying this principle to compound keys, the reaction is
	"no way". Rails will do what it does, and will not complicate itself
	to support things it doesn't like.</p><p>Here is a solid example of what makes Rails "opinionated
	software". In the Rails mindset, life is much simpler if you keep
	your tables isomorphic to your objects, and give your tables
	surrogate, integer, primary keys. If you play the Rails way - life
	is easy; if not - use something else.</p><p>I confess I like this opinionated attitude. Perhaps it reflects my
	Unix background, which thrives on many tools that do one thing well,
	rather than a complex tool that tries to do many different things. I
	like Rails's focus, its determination to pick a certain class of
	application and serve that well.</p><p>In this sense I see a startling parallel between DHH and Kent
	Beck. For either of them, if you present them with a constrained
	world, they'll look at constraints we take for granted,
	consider them to be unessential, and create a world without them. I
	don't have that quality, I tend to try to work within the
	constraints gradually pushing at them, while they just stick some
	intellectual dynamite under them and move on. That's why they can
	create things like Extreme Programming and Rails which really give
	the industry a jolt.</p><p>Lying under PragDave's talk was a deeper concern. Like me he's
	spent much of this life working with people who can't apply the
	dynamite. When you need data from a database that's run by a data
	management group and has run for a decade with compound keys, you
	can't just don a pair of cool sunglasses and blow the constraint
	away. One answer to this is to "change your organization or change
	your organization", but to those who can't should they be utterly
	abandoned by Ruby?</p><p>The last word of the last paragraph is the key to the
	answer. Rails is right, I think, to ignore the enterprisey world,
	but that doesn't mean that Ruby should. One of the great strengths
	of scripting languages, like Ruby, is their
	<a href = 'http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/PostModernProgramming.html'>post-modern</a> delight in diving into the muck of a chaotic software
	ecosystem. Ruby is a great place for other frameworks to fill the
	gaps left behind by Rails's opinions.</p><p>My colleague Badri gave a talk, that was sadly not very well
attended, about one of these - rBatis. rBatis is a ruby port of the
popular Java framework <a href = 'http://ibatis.apache.org'>iBatis</a>
(led by Clinton Begin, another colleague). The port is being done by
yet a third colleague <a href = 'http://jutopia.tirsen.com/'>Jon
Tirs&eacute;n</a>. rBatis is still a work in progress but already it
shows the same elements that made iBatis popular - fearlessly
embracing the strength of SQL rather than just trying to hide it under
layer of Query Objects. It also strengthens its appeal by making the
most of Ruby - stealing many functions from Active Record (such as
validation), and using
convenient Ruby syntax rather than XML. (Is XML the hunchback of
programming languages?) rBatis could be the answer to complicated
database issues, still fitting into a Rails web-app, but introducing a
different set of trade-offs. If you're comfortable with SQL, rBatis
looks pretty damn simple. (BTW any Rubyists out there Sydney? We may
need you to kidnap Jon's surfboard if work slows down on rBatis.)</p><p>All this tilts our perspective. Enterprise Rails may well be
	an oxymoron, but Enterprise Ruby is anything but. Indeed as I look at
	the way the enterprise world is going - a greater use of messaging,
	autonomous services featuring <a href = 'ApplicationDatabase.html'>ApplicationDatabase</a>s, a
	post-modern acceptance of variety - <a href = 'http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi/Tech/UnsetGlue.html'>the glue that doesn't set</a> seems
	to be the ideal tool.</p><p>Although some people felt these talks implied that there was a rift appearing between the
Davids, further conversation suggests to me any rift is founded
on misunderstanding (now there's a mangled metaphor). PragDave's call
wasn't for Rails to support these things but for the wider community
to find a way. Similarly DHH's response was about the Rails core team;
which hardly limits other peoples' efforts - as rBatis demonstrates.
Furthermore DHH felt that most of PragDave's calls were consistent
with the Core. The notion of a narrow core rails and a wider
ruby world (including rails) supports both concerns - this is the
strength of composing small tools.</p><p>However this wide-ruby / narrow-rails view of the world has a
	catch. I joked during my keynote that RailsConf was a sign of a
	failure of Rails - since if it was truly successful Rails would be
	too simple to need a conference. The underlying truth, however, is
	that Rails has become the keyword for Web apps (even Enterprise
	apps) in Ruby. I suspect we'll see more enterprisey people at
	RailsConf than at <a href = 'http://www.rubyconf.com/'>RubyConf</a>, because Rails has got the
	attention. The consequence of this is that there's a danger that
	people will hear the opinionated nature of Rails as
	a statement about Ruby, and thus give the impression that Ruby isn't
	a suitable enterprise glue. That would be a shame.</p><hr></hr></td>

<p></p>
<p>In my recent post on <a href = 'EvaluatingRuby.html'>EvaluatingRuby</a> I mentioned that a colleague
	had put together a web app with some fancy numerical graphs. Someone
	emailed to ask how he did that. I added my short answer, ploticus,
	to the original bliki entry, but that led to the question of how he
	interfaced ruby with ploticus?</p><p>I actually ran into a similar problem myself recently as I wanted
	to use ploticus to graph some data for a personal project. The
	solution I came up with was actually very similar, if rather less
	refined, than the one my colleague used. As a result I thought I'd
	share it.</p><p>First a caveat - this is literally something I knocked up one
	evening. It isn't intended to be robust, performant or otherwise
	enterprisey. It's just for some data I use for me, myself, and I.</p><p>A sophisticated way to drive a C library like ploticus is to bind
	directly to the C API. Ruby makes this easy, so I'm told, but it's
	too much work for me (particularly if I want to be done before
	cocktail-hour). So my approach is to build a ploticus script and
	pipe it into ploticus. Ploticus can run by taking a script from
	standard input that controls what it does, so all I have to do is
	run ploticus within ruby and pipe commands into it. Roughly like
	this:</p><pre>
  def generate script, outfile
    IO.popen("ploticus -png -o #{outfile} -stdin", 'w'){|p| p &lt;&lt; script}
  end
</pre><p>To build up the script, I like to get objects that can work in my
	terms, and produce the necessary ploticus stuff. If you have
	anything that uses the prefabs, then putting together something is
	easy. I wanted to do clustered bar graphs, <a href = 'http://ploticus.sourceforge.net/gallery/students.htm'>like this</a>, which requires
	a ploticus script. </p><p>I built what I needed in three levels. At the lowest level is
	PloticusScripter, a class that builds up ploticus script
	commands. Here it is:</p><pre>
class PloticusScripter
  def initialize
    @procs = []
  end
  def proc name
    result =  PloticusProc.new name
    yield result
    @procs &lt;&lt; result
    return result
  end
  def script
    result = ""
    @procs.each do |p|
      result &lt;&lt; p.script_output &lt;&lt; "\n\n"
    end
    return result    
  end
end
class PloticusProc
  def initialize name
    @name = name
    @lines = []
  end
  def script_output
    return (["#proc " + @name] + @lines).join("\n")
  end
  def method_missing name, *args, &amp;proc
    line = name.to_s + ": "
    line.tr!('_', '.')
    args.each {|a| line &lt;&lt; a.to_s &lt;&lt; " "}
    @lines &lt;&lt; line
  end
end</pre><p>As you see the scripter is just a list of proc commands (well
	they could be anything that responds to script_output - but I didn't
	need anything else yet). I can instantiate the scripter, call proc
	repeatedly to define my ploticus procs, then when I'm done call
	script to get the entire script for piping into ploticus.</p><p>The next level is something to build clustered bar graphs:</p><pre>
class PloticusClusterBar 
  attr_accessor :rows, :column_names
  def initialize
    @rows = []
  end
  def add_row label, data
    @rows &lt;&lt; [label] + data
  end
  def getdata scripter
    scripter.proc("getdata") do |p|
      p.data generate_data
    end
  end
  def colors
    %w[red yellow blue green  orange]
  end
  def clusters scripter
    column_names.size.times do |i|
      scripter.proc("bars") do |p|
        p.lenfield i + 2
        p.cluster i+1 , "/", column_names.size
        p.color colors[i]
        p.hidezerobars 'yes'
        p.horizontalbars 'yes'
        p.legendlabel column_names[i]
      end    
    end
  end

  def generate_data
    result = []
    rows.each {|r| result &lt;&lt; r.join(" ")}
    result &lt;&lt; "\n"
    return result.join("\n")    
  end  
end
</pre><p>This allows me to build a graph with simple calls to
	<code>add_row</code> to add data rows. This makes it much more easy
	for me to build up the data for the graph.</p><p>To make a particular graph, I'll write a third class on top of
	that:</p><pre>
#produces similar to  ploticus example in ploticus/gallery/students.htm

class StudentGrapher
  def initialize
    @ps = PloticusScripter.new
    @pcb = PloticusClusterBar.new
  end
  def run
    load_data
    @pcb.getdata @ps
    areadef
    @pcb.clusters @ps    
  end
  def load_data
    @pcb.column_names = ['Exam A', 'Exam B', 'Exam C', 'Exam D']
    @pcb.add_row '01001', [44, 45, 71, 89]
    @pcb.add_row '01002', [56, 44, 54, 36]
    @pcb.add_row '01003', [46, 63, 28, 87]
    @pcb.add_row '01004', [42, 28, 39, 49]
    @pcb.add_row '01005', [52, 74, 84, 66]    
  end
  def areadef
    @ps.proc("areadef") do |p|
      p.title "Example Student Data"
      p.yrange 0, 6
      p.xrange 0, 100
      p.xaxis_stubs "inc 10"
      p.yaxis_stubs "datafield=1"
      p.rectangle 1, 1, 6, 6
    end
  end
  def generate outfile
    IO.popen("ploticus -png -o #{outfile} -stdin", 'w'){|p| p &lt;&lt; script}
  end
  def script
    return @ps.script
  end

end


def run
  output = 'fooStudents.png'
  File.delete output if File.exists? output
  s = StudentGrapher.new
  s.run
  s.generate output
end

</pre><p>It's a very simple example, but it's a good illustration of what
	I call the <a href = 'http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/gateway.html'>Gateway</a>
	pattern. The PloticusClusterBar class is the gateway with the
	perfect interface for what I want to do. I make it transform between
	that convenient interface and what the real output needs to be. The
	PloticusScripter class is another level of gateway. Even for a
	simple thing like this I find a design of composed objects like this
	a good way to go. Which may only say how my brain's got twisted over
	the years.</p><hr></hr></td>

<p>If you're reading this I assume you're aware of the fact that
	there's been a huge amount of fuss about the Ruby programming
	language, and in particular the Rails framework for developing web
	applications. Some see it as the future of programming, others as a
	dangerous diversion.</p><p>I started with ruby several years ago. The <a href = 'http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/'>pragmatics</a> got me
	interested and it soon became my preferred scripting language. Over
	time it grew to handle much of the production of this website - in
	particular this bliki. I like the language a lot.</p><p>There's a jump between my personal liking and whether it's
something that should be used by our clients. We can evaluate its
suitability for client projects based on its features - and this leads
to many arguments about the pros and cons of dynamic typing, convention
over configuration, processes versus threads, and the like. Such
discussions are useful but I remain wary of them. Too many things are
hard to judge that way - hence we spend so much of our time on client
projects being slowed down by technology that sounded good on a golf
course. My preference is to make this judgment based on experience - 
find people who have a track record for delivering in the mainstream
environments and who have tried using Ruby. </p><p>Some of this can be seen with public writers. Ruby has attracted
	many people who have good experience elsewhere but feel Ruby gives
	them an additional edge, names like the <a href = 'http://www.toolshed.com/blog'>both</a> the <a href = 'http://pragprog.com/pragdave'>Prags</a>, <a href = 'http://blogs.relevancellc.com/'>Justin Gehtland</a>,
	<a href = 'http://weblogs.java.net/blog/batate/'>Bruce Tate</a>, <a href = 'http://www.jroller.com/page/dgeary'>David Geary</a> et al should be enough to make Ruby worth
	looking at. But parochial as I may be I've been keeping my ear
	closest to ThoughtWorkers: people whose history I know and whose
	projects I can more easily check up on.</p><p>It's still early days yet, but I now have a handful of project
	experiences to draw on. So far the results are firmly in favor of
	Ruby. When I ask the question "do you think you're significantly
	more productive in Ruby rather than Java/C#", each time I've got a
	strong 'yes'. This is enough for me to start saying that for a suitable
	project, you should give Ruby a spin. Which, of course, only leaves
	open the small question of what counts as 'suitable'.</p><p>One thing to mention is that although we have a couple of what I
	might call typical web projects that fit in well with what's
	currently talked about as prime Rails territory, there are also
	elements that are different. </p><ul><li>A kiosk device where
	consumers are directly manipulating a touch screen. Rails is present
	here, as the UI is a very Ajaxian web front end. But there's also
	communication with hardware devices, crypto, odd networking stuff -
	all on an appliance like Linux box.</li><li>A lot of SQL
	manipulation in batch processes where Ruby is used to specify what's
	needed and the resulting Ruby expressions are converted to SQL to
	carry out the real work. There's a splash of Rails on the front end
	- but again it's not the typical Rails app.</li><li>A project that looks like a standard web app in many ways, but
		involves a great deal of munging data from different formats and
		some very fancy graphs and charts (using <a href = 'http://ploticus.sourceforge.net/'>Ploticus</a>).</li></ul><p>In all these cases, those involved said they are getting
	functionality, and value, faster out of the door than they had in
	other platforms. This suggests to me that if you're looking for
	delivery speed and productivity you should take a serious look at Ruby.</p><p>There are still some open questions. In particular it's still too
	early to see what happens in later enhancement stages, particularly
	when you get team changes. Some people think that the dynamic nature
	of Ruby and the lack of tools will be a problem, others that the
	simplicity that Ruby encourages will make up for the
	difference. Such is the nature of the question that we can't really
	tell yet - I'll update you when I find out more.</p><p>Cedric Beust <a href = 'http://www.beust.com/weblog/archives/000382.html'>argues effectively</a> that even if Ruby is a superior
platform it may not become mainstream. I certainly understand that argument,
like many an ex-smalltalker I've long known of more productive
platforms than the current mainstream enterprise choices. If it's
important to you that you are only using mainstream platforms, you'll
need to wait longer to see what happens. There are plenty of course,
who <a href = 'http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000584.html'>don't care about following the mainstream</a>.</p><p>There's also plenty of projects where development productivity is
	swamped by political and other communication factors. Here Ruby's
	advantage would be significantly attenuated.</p><p>But overall these experiences, from trusted colleagues mean I'm
increasingly positive about using Ruby for serious work where speed,
responsiveness, and productivity are important.</p><hr></hr></td>
