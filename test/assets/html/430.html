  <A name="id2247761"></A><h2>Overview</h2>
    <A name="id2247763"></A><h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>REXML is a conformant XML processor for the Ruby programming
      language. REXML passes 100% of the Oasis non-validating tests and
      includes full XPath support. It is reasonably fast, and is implemented
      in pure Ruby. Best of all, it has a clean, intuitive API. REXML is
      included in the standard library of Ruby</p>

      <p>This software is distribute under the <a href="LICENSE.txt">Ruby
      license</a>.</p>
    

    <A name="id2247788"></A><h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>REXML arose out of a desire for a straightforward XML API, and is an
      attempt at an API that doesn't require constant referencing of
      documentation to do common tasks. "Keep the common case simple, and the
      uncommon, possible."</p>

      <p>REXML avoids The DOM API, which violates the maxim of simplicity. It
      does provide a DOM model, but one that is Ruby-ized. It is an
      XML API oriented for Ruby programmers, not for XML programmers coming
      from Java.</p>

      <p>Some of the common differences are that the Ruby API relies on block
      enumerations, rather than iterators. For example, the Java code:</p>

      <div class="example"><pre>for (Enumeration e=parent.getChildren(); e.hasMoreElements(); ) { 
  Element child = (Element)e.nextElement(); // Do something with child 
}</pre></div>

      <p>in Ruby becomes:</p>

      <div class="example"><pre>parent.each_child{ |child| # Do something with child }</pre></div>

      <p>Can't you feel the peace and contentment in this block of code? Ruby
      is the language Buddha would have programmed in.</p>

      <p>One last thing. If you use and like this software, and you're in a
      position of power in a company in Western Europe and are looking for a
      software architect or developer, drop me a line. I took a lot of French
      classes in college (all of which I've forgotten), and I lived in Munich
      long enough that I was pretty fluent by the time I left, and I'd love to
      get back over there.  You can contact me at: jobsforsean (at) germane (hyphen) 
      software (dot) com.</p>

  <A name="id2247949"></A><h2>Operation</h2>
    <A name="id2247953"></A><h3>Installation</h3>
      <p>You don't have to install anything; if you're running a
      version of Ruby greater than 1.8, REXML is included. However, if you
      choose to upgrade from the REXML distribution, run the command:
      <TT>ruby bin/install.rb</TT>. By the way, you really should look at
      these sorts of files before you run them as root. They could contain
      anything, and since (in Ruby, at least) they tend to be mercifully
      short, it doesn't hurt to glance over them. If you want to uninstall
      REXML, run <TT>ruby bin/install.rb -u</TT>.</p>
    

    <A name="id2247981"></A><h3>Unit tests</h3>
      <p>If you have Test::Unit installed, you can run the unit test cases.
      Run the command: <TT>ruby bin/suite.rb</TT>; it runs against the
      distribution, not against the installed version.</p>
    

    <A name="id2247996"></A><h3>Benchmarks</h3>
      <p>There is a benchmark suite in <TT>benchmarks/</TT>. To run the
      benchmarks, change into that directory and run <TT>ruby
      comparison.rb</TT>. If you have nothing else installed, only the
      benchmarks for REXML will be run. However, if you have any of the
      following installed, benchmarks for those tools will also be run:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>NQXML</li>

        <li>XMLParser</li>

        <li>Electric XML (you must copy <TT>EXML.jar</TT> into the
        <TT>benchmarks</TT> directory and compile
        <TT>flatbench.java</TT> before running the test)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The results will be written to <TT>index.html</TT>.</p>
    

    <A name="id2248050"></A><h3>General Usage</h3>
      <p>Please see <a href="docs/tutorial.html">the Tutorial</a>.</p>

      <p>The API documentation is available <a href="http://www.germane-software.com/software/XML/rexml/doc">on-line</a>,
      or it can be downloaded as an archive <a href="http://www.germane-software.com/software/archives/rexml_api_3.1.7.3.tgz">in
      tgz format (~70Kb)</a> or (if you're a masochist) <a href="http://www.germane-software.com/software/archives/rexml_api_3.1.7.3.zip">in
      zip format (~280Kb)</a>. The best solution is to download and install
      Dave Thomas' most excellent <a href="http://rdoc.sourceforge.net">rdoc</a> and generate the API docs
      yourself; then you'll be sure to have the latest API docs and won't have
      to keep downloading the doc archive.</p>

      <p>The unit tests in <TT>test/</TT> and the benchmarking code in
      <TT>benchmark/</TT> provide additional examples of using REXML. The
      Tutorial provides examples with commentary. The documentation unpacks
      into <a href="doc/index.html"><TT>rexml/doc</TT></a>.</p>

      <p>Kouhei Sutou maintains a <a href="http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml_doc_ja/current/index.html">Japanese
      version</a> of the REXML API docs. <a href="http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml_doc_ja/current/japanese_documentation.html">Kou's
      documentation page</a> contains links to binary archives for various
      versions of the documentation.</p>
    
  

  <A name="id2248144"></A><h2>Status</h2>
    <A name="id2248146"></A><h3>Speed and Completeness</h3>
      <p>Unfortunately, NQXML is the only package REXML can be compared
      against; XMLParser uses expat, which is a native library, and really is
      a different beast altogether. So in comparing NQXML and REXML you can
      look at four things: speed, size, completeness, and API.</p>

      <p><a href="benchmarks/index.html">Benchmarks</a></p>

      <p>REXML is faster than NQXML in some things, and slower than NQXML in a
      couple of things. You can see this for yourself by running the supplied
      benchmarks. Most of the places where REXML are slower are because of the
      convenience methods<SUP><A href="#id2248172">5</A></SUP>. On the positive side, most of the convenience
      methods can be bypassed if you know what you are doing. Check the <a href="benchmarks/index.html"> benchmark comparison page</a> for a
      general comparison. You can look at the benchmark code yourself
      to decide how much salt to take with them.</p>

      <p>The sizes of the XML parsers are close<SUP><A href="#id2248200">6</A></SUP>. NQXML 1.1.3 has 1580 non-blank, non-comment lines of code;
      REXML 2.0 has 2340<SUP><A href="#id2248209">7</A></SUP>.</p>

      <p>REXML is a conformant XML 1.0 parser. It supports multiple language
      encodings, and internal processing uses the required UTF-8 and UTF-16
      encodings. It passes 100% of the Oasis non-validating tests.
      Furthermore, it provides a full implementation of XPath, a SAX2 and a
      PullParser API.</p>
    

    <A name="id2248227"></A><h3>XPath</h3>
      <p>As of release 2.0, XPath 1.0 is fully implemented.</p>

      <p>I fully expect bugs to crop up from time to time, so if you see any
      bogus XPath results, please let me know. That said, since I'm now
      following the XPath grammar and spec fairly closely, I suspect that you
      won't be surprised by REXML's XPath very often, and it should become
      rock solid fairly quickly.</p>

      <p>Check the "bugs" section for known problems; there are little bits of
      XPath here and there that are not yet implemented, but I'll get to them
      soon.</p>

      <p>Namespace support is rather odd, but it isn't my fault. I can only do
      so much and still conform to the specs. In particular, XPath attempts to
      help as much as possible. Therefore, in the trivial cases, you can pass
      namespace prefixes to Element.elements[...] and so on -- in these cases,
      XPath will use the namespace environment of the base element you're
      starting your XPath search from. However, if you want to do something
      more complex, like pass in your own namespace environment, you have to
      use the XPath first(), each(), and match() methods. Also, default
      namespaces force you to use the XPath methods, rather than the
      convenience methods, because there is no way for XPath to know what the
      mappings for the default namespaces should be. This is exactly why I
      loath namespaces -- a pox on the person(s) who thought them up!</p>
    

    <A name="id2248273"></A><h3>Namespaces</h3>
      <p>Namespace support is now fairly stable. One thing to be aware of is
      that REXML is not (yet) a validating parser. This means that some
      invalid namespace declarations are not caught.</p>
    

    <A name="id2248285"></A><h3>Mailing list</h3>
      <p>There is a low-volume mailing list dedicated to REXML. To subscribe,
      send an empty email to <a href="mailto:ser-rexml-subscribe@germane-software.com">ser-rexml-subscribe@germane-software.com</a>.
      This list is more or less spam proof. To unsubscribe, similarly send a
      message to <a href="mailto:ser-rexml-unsubscribe@germane-software.com">ser-rexml-unsubscribe@germane-software.com</a>.</p>
    

    <A name="id2248311"></A><h3>RSS</h3>
      <p>An <a href="http://www.germane-software.com/projects/rexml/timeline?ticket=on&amp;max=50&amp;daysback=90&amp;format=rss">RSS
      file</a> for REXML is now being generated from the change log. This
    allows you to be alerted of bug fixes and feature additions via "pull".
    <a href="http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/rss.xml">Another
      RSS</a> is available which contains a single item: the release notice
    for the most recent release.  This is an abuse of the RSS
      mechanism, which was intended to be a distribution system for headlines
      linked back to full articles, but it works. The headline for REXML is
      the version number, and the description is the change log. The links all
      link back to the REXML home page. The URL for the RSS itself is
      http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/rss.xml.</p>

      <p>The <a href="release.html">changelog itself is here</a>.</p>

      <p>For those who are interested, there's a <a href="docs/sloccount.txt">SLOCCount</a> (by David A. Wheeler) file
      with stats on the REXML sourcecode. Note that the SLOCCount output
      includes the files in the test/, benchmarks/, and bin/ directories, as
      well as the main sourcecode for REXML itself.</p>
    

    <A name="id2248369"></A><h3>Applications that use REXML</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
<a href="http://www.pablotron.org/software/raggle/">Raggle</a> is a
        console-based RSS aggregator.</li>

        <li>
<a href="http://www.zweknu.org/technical/index.rhtml?s=p%7C10/">getrss</a>
        is an RSS aggregator</li>

        <li>Ned Konz's <a href="http://www.bikenomad.microship.com/ruby/">ruby-htmltools</a>
        uses REXML</li>

        <li>Hiroshi NAKAMURA's <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/raa-list.rhtml?name=SOAP4R">SOAP4R</a>
        package can use REXML as the XML processor.</li>

        <li>Chris Morris' <a href="http://clabs.org/clxmlserial.htm">XML
        Serializer</a>. XML Serializer provides a serialization mechanism
        for Ruby that provides a bidirectional mapping between Ruby classes
        and XML documents.</li>

        <li>Much of the <a href="http://www.rubyxml.com">RubyXML</a>
        site is generated with scripts that use REXML. RubyXML is a great
        place to find information about th intersection between Ruby and
        XML.</li>
      </ul>
    

    <A name="id2248442"></A><h3>Known Bugs</h3>
<p>You can submit bug reports and feature requests, and view the list of
      known bugs, at the <a href="http://www.germane-software.com/projects/rexml">REXML bug report
      page.</a> Please do submit bug reports. If you really want your bug
      fixed fast, include an runit or Test::Unit method (or methods) that
      illustrates the problem. At the very least, send me some XML that REXML
      doesn't process properly.</p>
<p>You don't have to send an entire test suite -- just the unit test
      methods. If you don't send me a unit test, I'll have to write one
      myself, which will mean that your bug will take longer to fix.</p>
<p>When submitting bug reports, please include the version of Ruby and
      of REXML that you're using, and the operating system you're running on.
      Just run: <TT>ruby -vrrexml/rexml -e 'p
      REXML::VERSION,PLATFORM'</TT> and paste the results in your bug
      report. Include your email if you want a response about the bug.</p>
<ul>
<li>Attributes are not handled internally as nodes, so you can't
      perform node functions on them. This will have to change. It'll also
      probably mean that, rather than returning attribute values, XPath will
      return the Attribute nodes.</li>
<li>Some of the XPath functions are untested<SUP><A href="#id2248495">8</A></SUP>. Any XPath functions that don't work are also
      bugs... please report them. If you send a unit test that illustrates the
      problem, I'll try to fix the problem within a couple of days (if I can)
      and send you a patch, personally.</li>
<li>Accessing prefixes for which there is no defined namespace in an
      XPath should throw an exception. It currently doesn't -- it just fails
      to match.</li>
</ul>

    <A name="id2248514"></A><h3>To Do</h3>
<ul>
      <li>Reparsing a tree with a pull/SAX parser</li>

      <li>Better namespace support in SAX</li>

      <li>Lazy tree parsing</li>

      <li>Add XPath support for streaming APIs</li>

      

      

      <li>Make sure namespaces are supported in pull parser</li>

      

      <li>Better stream parsing exception handling</li>

      <li>I'd like to hack XMLRPC4R to use REXML, for my own
      purposes.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Requested features</h3>

      on rdoc, and it quickly surpassed API2XML in features. Since I was never
      really interested in maintaining a JavaDoc analog, I stopped support of
      API2XML, and am now recommending that people use
      rdoc.</div>
