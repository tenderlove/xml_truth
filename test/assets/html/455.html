<FONT SIZE=+2>B</FONT>etween 1949 and November 24, 1963, Ruby was arrested eight times by the Dallas Police Department.  The dates, charges, and dispositions of these arrests are as follows: February 4, 1949, Ruby paid a $10 fine for disturbing the peace.  July 26, 1953, Ruby was suspected of carrying a concealed weapon; however, no charges were filed and Ruby was released on the same day.  May 1, 1954, Ruby was arrested for allegedly carrying a concealed weapon and violating a peace bond; again no charges were filed and Ruby was released on the same day.  December 5, 1954, Ruby was arrested for allegedly violating State liquor laws by selling liquor after hours; the complaint was dismissed on February 8, 1955.  June 21, 1959, Ruby was arrested for allegedly permitting dancing after hours; the complaint was dismissed on July 8, 1959.  August 21, 1960, Ruby was again arrested for allegedly permitting dancing after hours; Ruby posted $25 bond and was released on that date.  February 12, 1963, Ruby was arrested on a charge of simple assault; he was found not guilty February 27, 1963.  Finally, on March 14, 1963, Ruby was arrested for allegedly ignoring traffic summonses; a $35 bond was posted.
<P>
When Ruby applied for a beer license in March 1961, he reported that he had been arrested "about four or five times" between 1947 and 1953.  Between 1950 and 1963, he received 20 tickets for motor vehicle violations, paying four $10 fines and three of $3.  In 1956 and 1959, Ruby was placed on 6 months' probation as a traffic violator.
<P>
Ruby was also frequently suspended by the Texas Liquor Control Board.  In August 1949, when he was operating the Silver Spur, he was suspended for 5 days on a charge of "Agents: Moral Turpitude." In 1953 Ruby received a 5-day suspension because of an obscene show, and, in 1954, a 10-day suspension for allowing a drunkard on his premises.  On February 18, 1954, he was suspended for 5 days because of an obscene striptease act at the Silver Spur and for the consumption of alcoholic beverages during prohibited hours.  On March 26, 1956.  Ruby was suspended by the liquor board for 3 days because several of his checks were dishonored.  On October 23, 1961, he received another 3-day suspension because an agent solicited the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption on licensed premises.

<P>
<IMG SRC="blueball.gif"> The general sleaziness of Ruby's club is conveyed by this <A HREF="images/striptease.jpg">contact sheet from the National Archives</A>.

How sinister was knowledge of Oswald and the Fair Play for Cuba Committee? In reality, news of Oswald's membership in this organization had been broadcast before 4:00 pm. Central time, and had been all over the media for almost eight hours at the time of Wade's press conference.

<H3>Did Ruby Lie About His Motive?</H3>

Conspiracists have always been suspicious about Ruby's claim, to the Warren Commission, that he shot Oswald so that Jackie Kennedy would not have to return to Dallas to testify at a Lee Oswald murder trial.  Indeed, many have claimed that this motive was fabricated by Ruby's first attorney, Tom Howard.  In fact, <A HREF="sorrow.htm">Ruby was sincere about Mrs. Kennedy</A>, although that was hardly the whole story.

The following is from Elmer Gertz' <EM>Moment of Madness</EM>, pp. 472-474.  This
letter was written by Jack Ruby to his brother Earl during the time Ruby
was imprisoned, and was sinking further and further into a delusional state. <P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
EARL:
<P>
	You must believe what I've been telling you for the past two and a
half years. If you only would have believed me all along you would have
found some way to check out what I said. You would have saved Israel, but
now they are doomed, because they think the U.S. are for them, but they
are wrong because Johnson wants to see them slaughtered and tortured.
Egypt is making believe they are an ally of Russia, that is only to fool
Russia and the rest of the world. The Arabs are going to over- run Israel.
They are going to get help both from Russia and the U.S. It's too late now
to do anything, and we are all doomed. 
<P>
	They are torturing children here. If you only would believe what
I'm telling you. Phil [Burleson] was in on the conspiracy all along, and
he was very instrumental in the frameup they planned, that I was in on the
assassination of the President. Don't be fooled by his working on the
briefs, now that has done all the dirty work, he put himself in a position
to make every effort that he is on our side. Please you must believe all
I've been telling you. Earl, they are going to torture you to death, and
you will witness your own family being put to death. Forgive me for all
this terrible tragedy I've caused. Love
<P>
	I know you won't listen to me Earl, but if you go to a public
phone booth, they may be watching you, pretend that you are going to a
department store or a movie, and then give them the slip. Try the phone
booth and call some people in N.Y. you know, and if you don't find them
in, you will know something is wrong. Try your family again and if they
are not at home, then try Eileen or Ann. If they don't answer then you
know something is wrong. Earl I know what I am talking about, and I'm sure
you think that I'm crazy. But don't forget the jury found me sane, so I'm
not crazy anymore! If you know your family is gone, then you know that all
is lost and you can't save anything. But you still may be able to save
Israel. By getting to Miami either hitch-hike or some-way. You won't be
able to fly because they will be watching for you. From Miami you must
find a way to Cuba, by pretending to rent a boat to go fishing, and get to
Cuba someway. From there you must find a way to Russia. Then you tell the
Russians how Egypt has been using them all along, but they are much closer
to Johnson, because of what is happening to the Jews in the U.S. Then they
will understand what kind of person Johnson is, and then they may be able
to save Israel. 
<P>
	Russia will then be in a position to tell Johnson, that there
first move if any trouble starts is not to bomb the U.S., but to wipe out
Germany, that one thing Johnson don't want to happen, because he is
counting on them to be the master race, also all the other former Axis
partners South America, Egypt, Italy and Japan. 
<P>
	Earl, as God is my judge, you must believe all these things I've
been telling you. When you go back to your hotel, they may have a bug in
your room. Don't say anything to Elmer, just take off without your
clothes. Good luck and hope you believe me this time, Love always. 
<P>
	If you should follow what I said, and you are hitch-hiking give a
fictitious name, such Fleming etc. Try calling some local people, maybe
they are missing already, Scheppo, Jacobson, Kaufman and others through
the phone book. Please Earl, I know what I'm asking of you. 
<P>
	you [sic] must get to either Miami or Mexico City and then to
Cuba. You may have lost your family by now, but there is nothing you can
do about it now and you can save millions of people who are doomed to be
slaughtered. This country has been overthrown.

More of Ruby's paranoid delusions are revealed in a note that Ruby wrote to Gertz.  Here is the <A HREF="images/ruby_note3.jpg">envelope in which Gertz placed the note</A>, the <A HREF="images/ruby_note2.jpg">first page</A> of the note, and the <A HREF="images/ruby_note1.jpg">second page</A>.  Ruby not only believes that a second Holocaust is underway, he believes that Jews are being tortured and killed in the very building (the County Records Building on Dealey Plaza) were he is being held.  (Images are from the Library of Congress <A HREF="http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/">"American Memory"</A> collection.)

<P>
<H3>The Ruby Polygraph</H3>
<IMG SRC="blueball.gif"> Ruby, testifying before the Warren Commission, begged to be given a polygraph ("lie detector") test, and the Commission &#151; very much against its better judgment &#151; gave in to his entreaties.  Conspiracists have claimed that the polygraph test shows Ruby lying about knowing Oswald and being part of a conspiracy.  Unfortunately, as Dave Reitzes shows in <A HREF="http://www.jfk-online.com//rubyhscapoly.html">this essay from his web site</A>, "lie detector" tests have little value, and Ruby's test provides no evidence that he was lying.
