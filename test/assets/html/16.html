              You poor pathetic wretched washed-up musician. &nbsp;It is sad to 
              see how far you've sunk into the abyss of desperation. &nbsp;An 
              announcement in the HTC bulletin by your Bubby &amp; Zeide!! &nbsp;Now 
              that all remnants of your once proud career have disappeared, would 
              you like to be my roadie?<br>
              <strong><em>Allen Leiberman</em></strong><em>-Composer, Annoyer</em><br>
              <br>
              <strong><em>That, of course, was a joke. Here are the real testimonials:</em></strong><br>
              <br>
              Harris is far more authentic than, say, the Blues Brothers, but 
              closer to the easy-going B.B. King and Buddy Guy than scorched-earth 
              performers like Howlin’Wolf or big Mama Thornton. His voice is quite 
              expressive and reminiscent of Jerry Garcia’s or Levon Helm’s. The 
              fact that Harris doesn’t simply coast on his novelty, but always 
              reaches for a higher degree of playing, is a testament to his musicianship 
              and his dedication to the blues. If the violin is to be reintroduced 
              as a serious blues instrument, Harris makes a persuasive ambassador, 
              and “Almost Home” an irrefutable piece of diplomacy.<br>

              I put you right up there with Carlbach, MBD, Fried and the rest, 
              Ruby. You were <b><em>and are still</em></b> one of the true originals 
              in Jewish music...a no compromising genuine artist singing what's 
              inside of his inspired soul... it was always a pleasure. It was 
              a privilege to be on the same stage with you the few times we had 
              the chance to jam together. Sweet memories, Ruby. Just listened 
              to your CD samples. Your still getting better...if that's even possible. 
              Your biggest fan,<br>
              <b><em>Moshe Yess</em></b><em> --Legend <br>
              </em><br>
              <b>Material:</b> A veteran of the Chicago blues scene who has not 
              only performed at Carnegie Hall, but also appeared on MTV with Bob 
              Dylan and Tom Petty. Ruby Harris, billed as “The Father of Jewish 
              Rock,” fashions songs around a fiery electric violin, as well as 
              mandolin and guitar. While most of his material is blues inspired, 
              he also updates antiquated cover tunes that are so obscure they 
              may as well be originals. Almost psychedelic with a bluesy gossamer, 
              his music is moody, moving and entirely captivating. <br>
              </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Musicianship:</b> 
              Sounding like an all-star jam band, this group shines. Harris generally 
              leads the way with intricate runs that know no bounds. When one 
              player takes off into a sonic stratosphere the others quickly follow, 
              making this group unpredictable in its approach and structure. But, 
              it all works to perfection, especially when Harris riffs on his 
              violin.</font><br> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Performance:</b> 
              Skillful and agile, Ruby Harris created a unique environment like 
              no other. Hearing Delta blues and boogie-woogie played on a violin, 
              rather than a guitar or piano, was intriguing on its own, but that 
              soundscape was amplified by Harris with an intensity that was exotic 
              and exciting. A consummate performer, he told stories that held 
              the crowd and led nicely into each song. The only drawback was his 
              fondness for corny jokes. But, even that endeared him to his audience.<br>
              <b>Summary:</b> Ruby Harris played for almost an hour and a half, 
              and it wasn’t nearly long enough. His “Jews with Blues” style is 
              not only unique, it’s utterly spellbinding. Surprising, yet comforting, 
              Harris takes the blues beyond its typical territory and opens up 
              not only the whole genre, but his listeners’ minds as well. That 
              is the epitome of a real artist.<br>

              Last night I had the privilege in joining the great Ruby Harris

              Shlomo Carlebach at the convention. Everyone who attended the concert 
              was touched...the sound was great...we all jammed together at the 
              end to a spiritual high. (regarding) "There's A Voice" in memory

              Ruby Harris is an undisputable virtuoso on violin and mandolin. 
              &nbsp;He plays blues, klezmer, folk, rock and any other other genre 
              you can think of.<br>

              Rabbinical Haskama: I hereby recommend without any hesitation at 
              all, for anyone who loves good music with Jewish soul, to see the 
              one and only Ruby Harris in concert. I was honored to have had him 
              as a guest star two summers ago at the last Newburgh Jewish Music 
              Festival. He is without doubt one of the greats of our generation. 
              Not to be missed! With love of Israel,<br>

              Ruby Harris' "Almost Home" consists of eight self penned compositions 
              and tracks originally by Muddy, Chuck, Little Walter and even a 
              Hendrix influenced number. Besides the stunning electric violin 
              by Ruby himself other guests include Pinetop Perkins, Sugar Blue, 
              Lester Davenport and Little Mack Simmons among others<br>

              I believe your Almost Home album is a stroke of Jewish genius. As 
              an old Muddy Waters and Bo Diddley fan its an unbelievable event 
              in my life to connect to the mourning for the Bes Hamikdash(Broken 
              Glass) in the medium of Blues. And "Pour that Water" unbelievable! 
              Could we play that in the Third Temple please? Will the Rabbis allow 
              it? Shlomo probably would! May Hashem grant you further success 
              in using your talents for Avodas Hashem.<br>

              I've been enjoying your music very much. I like the diversity that 
              you have demonstrated so well, and there seems to be very few violin 
              players that play blues. It seems most violin players head toward 
              Jazz, but, to me, there is nothing quite like down and dirty blues.<br>
