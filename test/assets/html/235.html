      <p><font face="Verdana">[Slightly different version of article in
      <i>Las Vegas Review-Journal</i>, Aug. 31, 1997]</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana">Which is better: letting criminals go free, or 
prosecuting both a crime victim and a criminal? Folks who just want to let the 
criminals go should applaud the federal Department of Justice’s decision not to 
prosecute any of the federal officials involved in the fatal shootings of Vicki 
and Sammy Weaver, in Ruby Ridge, Idaho. Folks who like seeing the innocent and 
the guilty prosecuted simultaneously, though, should enjoy the decision of the 
Boundary County, Idaho, prosecutor to bring charges against both Lon Horiuchi 
(who killed Vicki Weaver) and against Kevin Harris (who has already been tried 
and acquitted for defending himself against an attack by federal agents).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Unfortunately, the decisions of both the federal 
and state prosecutors mean that several of the criminals at Ruby Ridge will 
never be charged with anything.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Consider Larry Potts, the Washington FBI 
headquarters man in charge of Ruby Ridge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The prosecutors investigated Larry Potts for 
approving the dramatic change in the &quot;rules of engagement&quot; for the FBI’s siege 
of the Weaver family’s remote Idaho cabin in August, 1992. According to the 
official FBI guidelines, deadly force is allowed only when necessary to protect 
someone against immediate danger. The rules of engagement are not based on the 
whims of FBI officials, or even on the acts of Congress. Instead, the limits on 
deadly force are implicit in the Constitution, and therefore decreed by the 
Supreme Court.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">At Ruby Ridge, Idaho, the normal, constitutional 
rules of engagement were changed; the new rules were orders to kill any armed 
adult male seen on the Weavers’ property. The non-prosecution of Larry Potts is 
based on a disputed fact: it cannot be proven that Potts approved the order 
saying FBI agents &quot;can and should&quot; shoot. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">But there is no real dispute that Potts approved 
an earlier change in the rules of engagement, saying the FBI &quot;could&quot; shoot any 
armed adult male. (Randy Weaver and his friend Kevin Harris often carried guns 
on their own property, as is completely legal under Idaho law.) Even if Potts 
didn’t approve the &quot;order to kill&quot; rules of engagement, he clearly did approve a 
&quot;license to kill&quot; rule, which is illegal and unconstitutional. But he’s getting 
away with it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">FBI sniper Lon Horiuchi-- who shot Vicki Weaver 
in the head while she was standing in the cabin doorway, holding her baby in her 
arms--is being charged with voluntary manslaughter by the local Idaho 
prosecutor. The federal government, though, is leaping to Horiuchi’s defense, 
because he was obeying an order. But the Nuremberg and My Lai prosecutions have 
established that &quot;I vas just following orders&quot; is no excuse for killing innocent 
people. The license-to-kill orders were so outrageous that other FBI snipers at 
the scene -- for example, the SWAT team from Denver -- agreed among themselves 
that the license-to-kill order should not be obeyed. The Denver agents chose to 
disobey the unconstitutional order, and instead to stick with the traditional 
rules of engagement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Besides choosing to obey an illegal 
assassination order, Horiuchi lied under oath at Randy Weaver’s trial. Horiuchi 
claimed that he opened fire on Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris because the two men 
were threatening to shoot an FBI helicopter. But the trial judge found this 
testimony so blatantly false that he ordered the charges related to the 
testimony to be dismissed. (The helicopter was nowhere near where Weaver or 
Harris could have shot at it.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Moreover, sniper Horiuchi violated even the 
illegal rules of engagement. True, he did obey the illegal orders when he shot 
at Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris, who were outside their cabin carrying guns.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">But Horiuchi’s second shot violated even the 
license to kill rules; the second shot was the one that killed Vicki Weaver, as 
she was standing in the doorway of her cabin, holding her baby.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The rules prohibited firing a shot if it would 
endanger any children.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Horiuchi claims that he never saw Vicki Weaver 
standing in the doorway, and his shot that killed her was really intended to 
kill Kevin Harris, who was running back into the cabin. Let’s assume that 
Horiuchi was telling the truth about what he saw. (Let’s also ignore the 
substantial evidence that the FBI had plans to kill Vicki Weaver--who was not 
accused of any crime--because she was the &quot;dominant&quot; member of the family.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Even Horiuchi’s version of the facts shows that 
he violated the rules. After the shooting, Horiuchi drew a diagram of the target 
he had aimed at. His drawing shows that he was aiming at a part of the door 
approximately ten inches above where he thought 16-year-old Sara Weaver was 
crouching. She wasn’t there, to be sure; but that’s where Lon Horiuchi was 
aiming -- just above the head of someone the rules of engagement prohibited him 
from endangering.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">And when he fired, in violation of the rules of 
engagement, he killed Vicki Weaver and injured Kevin Harris.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">This is the basis for the manslaughter charge 
against Horiuchi: his second shot was so reckless that he is culpable for the 
death that resulted.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">True enough, but what about Horiuchi’s first 
shot: his intentional, illegal attempt to kill Randy Weaver? Why no charge for 
this crime? And why no charge for all the FBI officials--from field commanders 
all the way up to Larry Potts, who authorized the FBI snipers to shoot people 
illegally?</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The FBI came on the scene a few hours after a 
shoot-out between a squad of U.S. Marshals and the Weaver family. Why are no 
charges being filed against the United States Marshal who shot fourteen-year-old 
Sammy Weaver in the back, as the unarmed Sammy was running home, away from the 
confrontation?</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Amazingly, the only person being charged by the 
Idaho prosecutor for the initial shoot-out is the Weavers’ friend Kevin Harris. 
During that shoot-out, Harris killed a United States Marshal, and said he was 
acting in self-defense. The federal government prosecuted him for the killing in 
1993, and he was acquitted.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The Constitution outlaws prosecuting a person 
twice for the same crime. But the Supreme Court has gutted this rule, by 
allowing separate prosecutions by the state and federal governments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Given the strange decisions of the federal and 
Idaho prosecutors, Congress and the state legislatures should promptly take two 
steps: First, enact legislation barring double state/federal prosecution for the 
same alleged crime. Second, pass resolutions calling for a special prosecutor to 
investigate the federal officials responsible for the deaths at Ruby Ridge.</font></p>
