        and was discontinued May 31, 1941. Ruby is one of the best preserved ghost 
        towns in Arizona. It is now undergoing restoration and you can visit the 
        site if you help in the restoration. For each day of work you get a day 
        of play. For forty years Ruby was called Montana Camp and in 1909 was 
        changed to Ruby in honor of one Julius Andrew's wife. Julius Andrews was 
        in charge of the camp store and was the one who applied for the post office. 
        At one time over 150 children went to school in Ruby and over 300 men 
        were employed at the Montana Mine.1941 saw the end of operations at Ruby 
        and it has been a ghost town since. For more infomation on Ruby from Tom

      <P>Ruby (Montana Camp) is 25 mile to the west after Peña Blanca junction 
        on SR 289. Possible to drive in 2 WD with careful driving. Ruby is one 
        of the leading ghost towns in the country, passed only by Vulture who 
        had more standing buildings. Ruby is total closed for visitors. Mining 
        in the area below Montana Peak began first in 1870 (eighties) and town 
        who grow up around became known as a Montana Camp. Owner of the general 
        store, Julius Andrews give the city his name when the post office was 
        established on April 11, 1912. He named the post office (and with this 
        the city) after his wife, Lillie B. Ruby Andrews. Philip C. Clarke bayed 
        Andrews general store in 1913 and build one bigger on the hill, were is 
        still standing. Because the area were close to the Mexican border and 
        attacks were almost daily, Clarke and his wife Gypsy had a weapons in 
        every room of the house and store. Their son Dan, one popular Arizona 
        man who died in 1922 told that his father send the mother to California 
        to born a baby because the situation in Ruby were dangerous. In the times 
        when all ranchers were attacked from the Mexican revolutionaries who crossed 
        the border, once Clark were asked by a older man with name Guzman, what 
        was that pipe looking apparaturess on front of his house? Clarke who loved 
        to joking with the old and serious man, told him that was a pipe system 
        witch made him possible (or: made him able) with a bottom beside his bed 
        to let out the poisoned gas, and that gas were strong enough to kill one 
        all regiment. Clarke enjoyed to see the old men walking far around from 
        pipes, witch actually were pipes for the rein water. When Guzman returned 
        one month later, Clarke asked him did he seen some revolutionary soldiers: 
        -"Oh, yes..... The checked everything I had with me, but they only took 
        my tobacco from me". Clarke asked him did they say they want to come to 
        Ruby store and Guzman answered: -"Yes, they asked Me about everything 
        and I tell them about your dead machinery - those pipes with the poison 
        gas". Solders decided to avoid the Ruby store. After this Clarke say: 
        -"I was much careful to talking about my dead spreading machine". Others 
        were not so lucky. Clarke leased the store to Alex and John Frasier in 
        1920 and suggested them to be good armed. Les then two months later lied 
        Alex dead beside cash register and John was shoot in one eye after he 
        were forced to open the store's safe. John lived only 5 hours more. One 
        of the two rowers were later killed when he refused to be arrested, but 
        he were able to kill the deputy, and the another robber was never found. 
        Clarke filed guilt for destiny of the Frasier brothers when Frank Phearson 
        came to buy the store. Phearson was sure that the lawless was not so big 
        and that attack was not possible. He became the next store owner and on 
        august 26, 1921 were him self and his wife killed by 7 armed man. Their 
        youngest daughter Margaret failed down when she tried to escape and when 
        she looked up, the butcher (killer) stand over her, and with non known 
        reason, he turned around and walked back in the store. Margaret Phearson 
        Anderson which survived became teacher in Nogales and Tucson, and retired 
        in 1980. Two of the 7 bandits were recognized when they escaped from Ruby. 
        Placido Silvas and Manuel Martinez were arrested, brought to the court, 
        convicted and send to be hanged. The Sheriffs car witch drive them to 
        the jail in Florence tipped over, killed the Sheriff and wounded the deputy, 
        and the prisoners escaped. Martinez were later captured and hanged in 
        the Florence jail. Silvas were never found and that's possible hi is still 
        in live today. The flourishing time in Ruby began in 1926 when Eagle-Picher 
        Lead Company over-take the mining. The town had a electricity (made by 
        diesel machines), doctor, hospital and one school with 3 teacher. Once 
        were over 150 children witch joined the school. >From 1934 until 1937, 
        Montana mine was a leading producer of lead and zinc in Arizona, and in 
        1936 was the third biggest in production of silver. The mine employed 
        over 300 men, but ore died in 1940 and the town witch once had about 2000 
        citizens, became ghost town in 1941. Post office closed on may 31, 1941. 
        Clarke's store which were intact until 1970, collapsed totally, but the 
        jail not far from there is still standing. The school still standing with 
        the basketball plate. On the south side of the city are mine offices and 
        owners residence. Another buildings are visible from the road, from the 
      little hill. Don't go in on the area without permission! Bobby Zlatevski </P>

      <P>How We Trapped the Deadly Border Bandits</P>
      <p>By</p>
      <p>Oliver Parmer</p>
      <p>As Told To</p>
      <p>Kathleen O&#8217;Donnell</p>
      <p>From</p>
      <p>Startling Detective Magazine; March 1936</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> As early dusk of February 27, 1920 settled over the deserted town of
        Ruby, Arizona, a Mexi&shy;can ranch hand shivered and pulled his frayed
        mackinaw closer about him as he trotted past boarded-up houses, to a
        for&shy;lorn building of adobe and weathered wood. The ramshackle building,
        a relic of better days when the copper and silver mines of Ruby were
        working, now housed the post office, general store, and home of the brothers,
        John and Alex&shy;ander Fraser, who eked out a precarious existence serving
        the needs of the meager population of the once pros&shy;perous Oro Blanco
        mining district.</p>
      <p>The Mexican dismounted on the dusty street and tied his horse to a rail.
        A chill wind howled eerily through the mouldering desert town as he tried
        the heavy door. Finding it locked, he pounded. A shutter banged disconso&shy;lately
        somewhere nearby.</p>
      <p>Receiving no answer he knocked again. The echo was his only response. &#8220;The
        boys must have gone to Nogales for the day,&#8221; he muttered to himself.
        Stepping to a window, he cupped his hands about his eyes and peered in
        through the failing light.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Madre de Dios!&#8221; he exclaimed for he could discern that
        the safe was wide open and its contents scattered. Without further investigation
        he leaped on his horse and galloped to the ranch of John Maloney, justice
        of the peace.</p>
      <p>He panted out his story.</p>
      <p>John Maloney, a stalwart old Indian fighter and peace officer who had
        yet to meet his match for courage, strapped on his .45 Colt, grabbed
        his Stetson, and called in his vaqueros.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Vamos! Let&#8217;s go,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;The post office
        has been robbed!&#8221;</p>
      <p>Later Maloney and his men pulled up their laboring horses in front of
        the building and walked briskly to the door. Lanterns were being lit
        when suddenly, almost like an echo, a low moan, faint but unmistakable,
        emanated from the building. A sensation of horror swept over the group.</p>
      <p>&#8220;My God, what was that?&#8221; Maloney asked grimly. One of the
        vaqueros crossed himself and murmured a prayer. The cry came again, this
        time lower and long drawn out. Scarcely audible, it seemed inhuman. </p>
      <p>&#8220;Quick! Break in the door,&#8221; ordered Maloney, drawing his
        gun. The men complied and, stepping over the broken door with lanterns
        held high, they glanced around the room. Sure enough there was the yawning
        safe. Maloney gasped and his face blanched for by the counter laid the
        crumpled form of Alex&shy;ander Fraser. An agonized moan drew their attention
        to the doorway leading to the living quarters. There lay the tortured
        body of John Fraser, his life&#8217;s blood oozing from a ghastly head
        wound.</p>
      <p>Beads of perspiration glistened on Maloney&#8217;s forehead. This was
        no suicide pact, no accidental shooting. It was plain robbery and murder.</p>
      <p>The telephone, the only one in Ruby, had been torn off the wall and
        its wires cut.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Gutierrez, take my horse and ride hard to Nogales. Get Sheriff
        Earhart and an ambulance.&#8221;</p>
      <p>At this time there were no autos in Ruby. Nogales, forty miles away,
        was the nearest town.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Double Tragedy</p>
      <p>So it was that in the early hours of dawn I was drawn into the investi&shy;gation
        by Sheriff Ray B. Earhart, for I was the Arizona Ranger in the Oro Blanco
        district. With three deputies we drove to Ruby as fast as road conditions
        permitted.</p>
      <p>Although we were prepared for the sight of death we were appalled at
        the grisly scene within the post office. Alexander was dead. A bullet
        had en&shy;tered his back, coursing to the front, and a second had penetrated
        his head. This unquestionably had caused instant death.</p>
      <p>John had been shot through the left eye and the bullet had passed through
        his skull. He was still alive but uncon&shy;scious. We placed him in
        the ambulance and sent him to a Nogales hospital. He was our one hope
        of learning just what had happened. But our hopes in this direction were
        blasted when he died en route to the hospital without regaining consciousness.</p>
      <p>It was evident to us that more than one man was responsible for these
        mur&shy;ders for Alexander had been shot twice and by weapons of different
        caliber. The absence of powder marks on the clothing and skin of the
        victims indicated that the fatal bullets had been fired from a dis&shy;tance.</p>
      <p>Gunplay was not uncommon in Ari&shy;zona where, due perhaps to the lingering
        spirit of the Old West, men often faced each other and shot it out. But
        this was different. Alexander Fraser had been shot in the back in cold
        blood after he evidently had complied with the demands of the killers
        by opening the safe.</p>
      <p>As to the characters of the Fraser brothers I learned much from Justice
        Maloney and others whom I questioned later. They had lived in Ruby for
        a number of years, were unobtrusive, well liked, and had no known enemies.
        They were especially kind to the Mexican peons in the district, often
        extending them credit for food. Seldom, indeed, had a crime seemed more
        cold-blooded.</p>
      <p> Was there something in these men&#8217;s past that brought on this
        killing? Was there some document hidden in the safe? Did the Frasers
        recognize the intruders and were the Frasers killed to prevent identification?</p>
      <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a curse on that building&#8221; one old timer told
        me. &#8220;How&#8217;s that, Dad?&#8221; I questioned.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Old Tio Pedro died years ago. He predicted evil for the occupants
        of the post office &#8216;cause it was built over an old padre&#8217;s
        grave.&#8221;</p>
      <p> From Maloney I learned that the Tio Pedro superstition was common among
        the poorer Mexicans.</p>
      <p>I made a close examination of the premises for clues but found nothing
        tangible. Beans in a pot on the stove were charred and a pan of biscuits
        in the oven were burned black showing that the Frasers were in the act
        of preparing their evening meal when they were in&shy;terrupted and struck
        down.</p>
      <p>The clang of the school bell within a stone&#8217;s throw of the post
        office sug&shy;gested a possible source of information. I went to the
        school and had a chat with the teacher.</p>
      <p>&#8220;On my way home at about four o&#8217;clock,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I
        passed two strange Mexican vaqueros eating apples at the old adobe ruins
        just above the post office.&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;What did they look like?&#8221; I asked eagerly.</p>
      <p>&#8220;They were typical vaqueros. One had a long drooping black mustache,
        the other a heavy beard. Their horses were grazing over in back of the
        ruins.&#8221;</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Clue of the Cigarettes</p>
      <p>With this as a lead, Maloney and I hurried over to the ruins in search
        of clues. We found two sets of fresh foot&shy;prints in the dust, the
        deep heel marks indicating that they had been made by men wearing the
        customary high-heeled cowboy boats. In a corner we found three apple
        cores and five cigarette butts. A curious thing about two of the cigarette
        butts was that the smoker, in putting them out, had broken the end off
        between his thumb and two fingers.</p>
      <p>Back at the post office I found another of these broken cigarettes and
        also a box of apples which indicated that the strange Mexicans had visited
        the store prior to the murders. The shooting had not taken place before
        four o&#8217;clock be&shy;cause the teacher and her pupils de&shy;clared
        they had heard no gun reports during the day.</p>
      <p>We were unable to gain further in&shy;formation about the vaqueros as
        no one else had seen them.</p>
      <p> Late that afternoon a prominent rancher of the Oro Blanco district
        re&shy;ported that two of his best saddle horses and eight head of cattle
        had been stolen during the night. Thinking there might be some connection
        between the murders and the cattle rustling we drove over to this ranch.
        We obtained horses for our posse and, picking up the cattle rustlers&#8217; trail,
        trotted out into the barren wilder&shy;ness after them. The fugitives
        were traveling fast, driving the cattle before them, confident that they
        could cross the border at some deserted point and be safe in Old Mexico
        by daylight.</p>
      <p> At this time Mexico was not recog&shy;nized by the United States and
        conse&shy;quently there was no treaty of extradi&shy;tion in effect,
        so that once across the border a criminal was perfectly safe. Although
        we were two days behind the bandits we kept on in the hope that they
        had been delayed in their efforts to smuggle the rustled cattle across
        the line.</p>
      <p> The following morning deputy sheriffs and civilians from Pima, Cochise,
        and Santa Cruz counties, armed with the de&shy;scriptions of the stolen
        stock, searched mountain gorges and hidden gulches of the Oro Blanco
        district while the immi&shy;gration officers and U. S. troops from Nogales
        patrolled the border.</p>
      <p>Our posses rode over tiresome hills veined with ore bodies of great
        richness, across dry washes flecked with gold, a land of vast distances,
        beauty, wealth, and opportunity where Spaniards of Coronado&#8217;s day
        marched over from Mexico in quest of the fabulous seven cities of Cibola.
        We did not get sight of the rustlers.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In the months that followed the in&shy;vestigation went on with Sheriff
        Earhart flooding the country with circulars describing the pod office
        killings. Many suspects were rounded up by able officers, but no charges
        were made. Cattle rustling continued in the Oro Blanco district and an
        occasional Mexican bul&shy;let whined across the line.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A New Postmaster</p>
      <p> A Year later found the Ruby post office in charge of young Frank Pearson,
        a native of Texas. Pearson was married and the father of a pretty four-year-old
        girl, Margaret. He purchased the stock in the store from the Fraser heirs
        and was assisted in his duties by his wife, Myrtle. That year, 1921,
        the rains were few and water holes dried. Hundreds of cattle died because
        of the drought.</p>
      <p>The Pearson&#8217;s grew lonely for even John Maloney went away for
        the summer leaving them eight miles from a habitated house. So Mrs. Pearson
        sent for her younger sister, Elizabeth Purcell, and also her husband&#8217;s
        sister, Irene. It was the first time the two girls had been away from
        their homes.</p>
      <p>The girls helped Myrtle Pearson with the household tasks and she and
        her hus&shy;band had more time to ride out over the brown hills. The
        morning of August 26 gave promise of another stifling day in the post
        office. The Pearson&#8217;s had their breakfast at seven o&#8217;clock
        and at eight Pearson opened the office as was his custom. Shortly thereafter,
        leaving the girls in charge, the couple mounted their ponies and rode
        out over the surrounding hills.</p>
      <p>From Ruby Mountain they looked down toward Mexico, the land of manana,
        of romance, and of other, more sinister, things when suddenly Pearson&#8217;s
        horse picked up his ears and braced his forelegs stiffly. Down below
        on the trail several vaqueros were galloping toward the post office.
        Pearson&#8217;s face beamed. &#8216;There is going to be business in
        the store and the girls may need us&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll race you back,&#8221; Myrtle cried, spurring her horse.</p>
      <p>They raced across the mesa in the balmy morning air avoiding clumps
        of cactus and scrub oak. They reached home breathless and radiant, with
        flushed faces. The vaqueros were leav&shy;ing as they drew up.</p>
      <p>Myrtle and her sister retired to the living quarters with little Margaret
        Irene began straightening the shelves; Pearson was sweeping the floor.
        The door opened. Two vaqueros reentered the store and strode to the counter.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Tobacco,&#8221; they ordered.</p>
      <p>As Pearson turned his back to reach for the tobacco the Mexicans exchanged
        significant glances.</p>
      <p>The next instant two guns roared. Irene screamed. Pearson staggered,
        drew his gun from under the counter and fired three wild shots at his
        assailants. Then death stilled his trigger finger.</p>
      <p>The killer with the drooping black mustache, leering evilly at Irene,
        waved his smoking gun at his companion and ordered him to get all the &#8220;gringo&#8217;s
        dinero&#8221; (money)</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A Second Murder</p>
      <p>Screaming at the top of her voice, Irene ran back into the rear of the
        building. The bandit pursued her, wav&shy;ing his pistol wildly. The
        blood froze in her veins. She stumbled. He caught her, grabbed her by
        the hair and dragged her across the room.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Stop! For God&#8217;s sake, stop!&#8221; Myrtle shrieked running
        into the room. The mustachioed one glanced up and avidly appraising Myrtle&#8217;s
        trim matronly figure roughly flung Irene aside. Then some&shy;thing else
        attracted him as Myrtle Pear&shy;son opened her mouth and screamed -
        the glint of five gold-crowned teeth! He sprang up, clutched her arms
        fiercely and brought the muzzle of his .45 down hard on her head. She
        collapsed, groaning. The killer stood up, as if en&shy;joying the situation,
        and aimed at her helpless body writhing in agony on the floor.</p>
      <p>Bang! Blood spurted from a wound in her neck. The fiend jerked her head
        around by the hair and, forcing her mouth open, calmly knocked out the
        gold crowns with the butt of his gun!</p>
      <p>While this mutilation was taking place little Margaret appeared in the
        doorway, her eyes wide with stark terror. Irene grabbed her before she
        could betray her presence. Together they rolled under a couch, where
        they remained unnoticed. Elizabeth in the meantime crawled behind the
        counter and obtained Pearson&#8217;s shotgun. But the mustachioed one
        was quick as a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cis.udel.edu/~davis/stamps/">cat</a>. There was another flash from his gun! An agonized
        scream! The shotgun clattered to the floor and Elizabeth slumped behind
        the counter.</p>
      <p> The killer seeing the bleeding and mutilated form of Myrtle Pearson
        twitch&shy;ing in agony on the floor bent over her. There was another
        roar. Her body stiffened, the twitching stopped.</p>
      <p>The bandits shot open the sale and went through its contents.</p>
      <p> Money, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.vistaprint.com/custom-stamps.aspx">stamps</a>, post office money orders were pocketed. They helped
        them&shy;selves to all groceries they could carry from the store&#8217;s
        shelves. They tore the telephone from the wall and walked out into the
        corral where they stampeded the Pearson&#8217;s horses by beating them
        with sombreros, howling like coyotes and firing their pistols. Jumping
        on their horses they were off. The echo of racing hoofs beat back and
        forth through the hills with taunting madness to the girls left in the
        house.</p>
      <p> Irene and little Margaret crawled from beneath the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Stamps/stamps.html">couch</a> uninjured.
        Irene re&shy;vived Elizabeth who had fainted. Her arm was bleeding where
        a bullet had grazed it. Frank and Myrtle Pearson were dead.</p>
      <p> The girls surveyed the shambles. They cried, dried their eyes and cried
        some more. With the telephone wires cut, the horses turned out, there
        was no way of summoning aid. Business was so quiet it might be days before
        some passerby came along.</p>
      <p> The two girls, still in their teens, and little Margaret suddenly were
        faced with heavy responsibilities. They couldn&#8217;t stay where they
        were, with the dead eyes of their loved ones staring at them.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Summon Aid</p>
      <p>Weeping and hysterical, the girls stumbled over a dusty desert trail
        in blazing heat of noonday to the ranch of their nearest neighbor eight
        miles away.</p>
      <p> &#8220;The Ruby post office has been robbed and the postmaster and
        his wife mur&shy;dered in cold blood,&#8221; was the word brought to
        Nogales that afternoon.</p>
      <p> With Sheriff George White, successor to Earhart, and three deputies
        I arrived at the scene of the crime just as the sun was sinking behind
        the topmost peaks of the Ruby Mountains. Chairs were over&shy;turned
        in the store, drawers were pulled out, papers scattered, the safe rifled,
        blood spattered on the floor, and boxes, bottles and canned goods strewn
        about.</p>
      <p> Pearson lay behind the counter in a pool of blood with two bullets
        in his back - stiff in death. His wife&#8217;s lifeless body lay sprawled
        on the floor. Her skull was fractured, a bullet had entered her neck
        and ranged downward, another had en&shy;tered her left temple and come
        out at the back of the head, her jaw was broken, her lips horribly mashed
        and lacerated.</p>
      <p> Many of her teeth had been knocked out but they were not on the premises.
        I turned from this shocking sight resolved to do my utmost to bring to
        justice the fiends responsible for this mutilating atrocity.</p>
      <p>White&#8217;s lips were set in a thin hard line, his face was pale with
        fury and I knew that he was as determined as I. He knew what I was thinking
        - Pearson shot in the back like Alexander Fraser and almost on the same
        spot where the latter had expired some eighteen months previously. The
        safe open, its contents scattered, the telephone torn from the wall as
        before.</p>
      <p>Were the same persons responsible for both double murders? Was robbery
        the motive? It seemed that old Tio Pedro&#8217;s legend was still working.</p>
      <p>A quick search of the building re&shy;vealed nothing further so I rode
        through somber scatterings of mesquite beneath a blanket of brilliant
        desert stars to the ranch house where the girls had taken refuge. I wanted
        to know what light they could throw on the case.</p>
      <p>They related the grim details of the murders. Their descriptions of
        the kill&shy;ers checked with that of the men the school teacher had
        seen on the afternoon of the Fraser killings.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Posses Take the Trail</p>
      <p>News of this latest atrocity at the Ruby post office spread rapidly
        through the Oro Blanco district. Peons in the vicinity crossed themselves
        and spoke darkly of old Tio Pedro&#8217;s super&shy;stition. Two Mexican
        women came for&shy;ward. One told how on the morning of the killing she
        had watched several vaqueros pass her place en route to the post office.
        The other woman recalled seeing some vaqueros pass her house on the trail
        to Sonora. The latter declared their horses were heavily packed.</p>
      <p>Grim visaged ranchers from far and near snatched up their rifles and
        saddled their horses to search the border country for these merciless
        killers.</p>
      <p>During the following weeks all the hectic madness and frantic energy
        of the old frontier were present. Days in the saddle and nights beneath
        the stars were the order of the day. Cars were of practically no value
        in the search the country was too difficult and there were few roads.
        Posses rode over the parched desert and into the cool reaches of the
        mountain passes searching, searching. An airplane was chartered from
        the army post at Nogales to fly over this district in an attempt to get
        sight of the bandits.</p>
      <p>It was the first airplane ever used in Arizona for a manhunt.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Offer Bandit Reward</p>
      <p>A reward of $5,000 dead or alive was posted for each of the murderous-outlaws.
        This added zest to the quest. I had a hunch the men were safe in Mexico.
        Acting on this, White and I slipped away and crossed the line into Sonora
        where we conferred with the Mexican officials. Although there was still
        no extradition treaty between our countries these officials assured us
        of their fullest personal cooperation.</p>
      <p>True to their word, on September 6, 1921, Sheriff White received a communication
        from General Calles Plank, commander of the Mexican army in Sonora to
        the effect that his soldiers had forced two Mexican desperadoes out of
        a can&shy;tina where they had boasted of robbing the Ruby post office.</p>
      <p>Thankful for this hot tip, though we did not know who these desperadoes
        were, White, four deputies and I lost no time in getting to the designated
        place in the wild desolate country north of Saric, Sonora. We picked
        up tracks where two men had crossed the border into Arizona. The next
        two days found us winding in and around sage brush and up through the
        rough timbered Pina Blanca Moun&shy;tains and across Bear Valley where,
        amid the bristling cholla and brown grease wood, shifting sands had obliterated
        all trace of our quarry. Again we returned to Nogales without our men.</p>
      <p>During the ensuing fall and winter months we ran down dozens of tips.
        Suspects were picked up on suspicion in Tucson, Los Angeles and El Paso.
        But they weren&#8217;t the men we sought</p>
      <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing certain,&#8221; White declared as we
        later conferred on the case. &#8220;The men we are after may be hiding
        in the mountains of Sonora awaiting their chance to strike again. But
        while there&#8217;s still a chance that they&#8217;re on our side of
        the line we&#8217;ve got to keep after them.&#8221;</p>
      <p>By April, 1922, we had almost given up hope of ever apprehending the
        mur&shy;derers, when there came a peculiar twist of fate. One of White&#8217;s
        deputies hap&shy;pened to be in a cantina in Sasabe, Sonora, a town thirty
        five miles south&shy;west of Ruby. He was standing at the bar when he
        overheard the bartender bargaining with a customer.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Sell you all of them for three pesos?</p>
      <p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ve only got two pesos.&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll keep them.&#8221;</p>
      <p>The deputy glanced around casually to see what was being sold. He paled
        when he saw five gold teeth lying on the counter. Five gold teeth, the
        same number that the murderous bandit had knocked from Myrtle Pearson&#8217;s
        pretty mouth! Gold teeth were rare among Mexicans. There was a possibility
        that this was a hot clue.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Where did you get these?&#8221; the deputy asked.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Oh, a feller by the name of Manuel Martinez sold them to me last
        fall. I had &#8216;em put away and just ran across them the other day
        and decided to sell them.&#8221; He grinned and leaned over confidenti&shy;ally: &#8220;I
        only paid sixty-five centavos for them.&#8221;</p>
      <p>Sixty-five cents Mex! The price of double murder! The deputy paid the
        astonished bartender his price and shud&shy;dered as he pocketed the
        teeth.</p>
      <p>After examining the teeth, White and I were positive that Martinez was
        the man we wanted. Here was a break at last.</p>
      <p>I had known Martinez by sight for years and also knew that his boon
        companion was a man named Placidio Silvas whose family lived in a shack
        in the Oro Blanco district.</p>
      <p>I saddled up my horse and poked over to the Silva&#8217;s place to pick
        up what in&shy;formation I could. I went alone so as not to arouse suspicion.
        Several months before I had questioned this same family, who were of
        the peon class, but they apparently had known nothing of the murder.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Trap One Suspect</p>
      <p>When I reached the Silva&#8217;s place, I noticed three horses saddled
        and tied outside. This indicated the presence of at least as many men
        inside. I chatted with a little girl and she told me Placidio was in
        the house. A bold course now scented wisest - to take them by surprise.</p>
      <p>I flung open the door and leveled my two six-shooters at the five occupants
        before they had time to realize what was up. I singled out Silvas, a
        brown-eyed, black-bearded youth.</p>
      <p>&#8220;You are coming with me to appear before Justice Maloney. You
        were in on that Pearson killing,&#8221; I told him. Silvas paled. &#8220;Caramba!
        I no do nothing bad.&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;Ah mi hijo- my little boy,&#8221; his mother wailed.</p>
      <p>&#8220;If any of you try to stop me, I will kill Placidio,&#8221; and
        I slowly fingered my guns.</p>
      <p>It was a dramatic moment as I was alone and taking a dangerous man to
        jail from the bosom of his family. His two brothers were armed and glaring
        fiercely at me. I snapped handcuffs on his sturdy wrists, took all their
        guns, and edged out the door. Leading Silvas to his pony, I snagged his
        wrists to the saddle horn. I forced his brothers to unsaddle their horses
        and turn them out of the corral. To avoid the highway on the way back
        with my prisoner in order to forestall an ambush, so we took out across
        the silent wastelands and skirted the foothills, breaking our own trail.
        I glanced back frequently and listened carefully for sounds of pursuit.
        There were none and I got my man to Ruby late in the afternoon of April
        29, 1922.</p>
      <p>&#8220;This is Placidio Silvas,&#8221; I told Ma&shy;loney. &#8220;He
        is one of the bandits in on the Pearson killings.&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;Smoke?&#8221; Maloney passed him a sack of tobacco and brown
        paper. Silvas deftly rolled a cigarette.</p>
      <p>Puff! Puff! He was perfectly calm.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Are you a Mexican citizen?&#8221; Maloney asked pointblank.</p>
      <p>Silvas looked up, surprised. He broke his cigarette in two and threw
        it on the floor grinding it with his booted heel.</p>
      <p>&#8220;I was born on this side, &#8216;way up in the Pi&ntilde;a Blanca
        Mountains,&#8221; he answered.</p>
      <p>Maloney and I looked down at the cigarette butt and exchanged knowing
        glances. We took Silvas before The Mexican women who had declared they
        had seen vaqueros pass their places the morning of the Person killings.
        They identified Silvas as one of the vaqueros. He was charged with the
        murder of Frank Person in Santa Cruz County. Because he had so many friends
        of the outlaw class we turned him over to Sheriff Ben Daniels of Pima
        County for safekeeping.</p>
      <p>On May 10, the Oro Blanco ranchers and sombreroed men from Sonora packed
        the Santa Cruz superior court where Placidio Silvas went on trial for
        his life.</p>
      <p>I was in the court room listening to the evidence when I received a
        tip that Martinez was hiding in The Pina Blanca Mountains. I quietly
        selected a posse and slipped away. As I was thoroughly familiar with
        these mountains, I placed an ambushed guard at all the principal springs
        and passes and tried to pick up Martinez&#8217; trail.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Strike Bandit Trail</p>
      <p>After two days in the saddle without results, I was poking along under
        the blazing sun and cursing our luck when the sound of rifle fire echoing
        through the hills jerked me to attention. I immediately started in the
        direction of the sound.</p>
      <p>I came across the fresh trail of a horse&shy;man in mad flight. I followed
        it and caught sight of my quarry just as he dis&shy;appeared over a sharp
        bluff. He had also caught sight of me. The chase led down an arroyo which
        spread out into a valley. I was gaining on him when sud&shy;denly his
        horse stumbled and fell. He was thrown over the horse&#8217;s head. He
        got up and tried to run. It was Martinez!</p>
      <p>&#8220;Las manos arriba!&#8221; I commanded sharply.</p>
      <p>He stopped and complied, raising his hands slowly. I removed his heavy
        .45 and slipped on a pair of handcuffs. The injured pony in the meantime
        had struggled to his feet but was groaning in pain. I found he had stepped
        in a rut and broken his leg.</p>
      <p>Martinez, I know you were in on the Person killings and I aim to get
        your confession,&#8221; I told him grimly.</p>
      <p>His dark face flushed.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Why did you kill them?&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;Quien sabe? &#8221; he grunted with a char&shy;acteristic Mexican
        shrug of the shoul&shy;ders.</p>
      <p>&#8220;You will sabe pronto,&#8221; I challenged. Slipping my lariat
        around his neck, I tossed the other end over the limb of a cottonwood
        tree, tied it to the pommel and mounted my horse.</p>
      <p>My bluff worked. With a wild ex&shy;pression on his face my captive
        began uttering a flow of words, incoherent at first, which were to shock
        two countries.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Speak English,&#8221; I commanded.</p>
      <p>&#8220;I kill Senora Pearson for the teeth of gold.&#8221;</p>
      <p>And the man with the drooping mus&shy;tache went on confessing how he
        and Silvas had divided the loot upon reaching their hideout in Sari,
        Sonora.</p>
      <p>Two of the posse rode up at this point and we fired six shots in rapid
        succession, the signal for the posse men to gather.</p>
      <p>We took turns riding double with Martinez until we reached the first
        ranch where we obtained a horse for him.</p>
      <p>The capture created quite a lot of ex&shy;citement in Nogales. It was
        sensational as the Silvas jury had been out two hours. Martinez was immediately
        booked for the murder of Myrtle Pearson. Feeling ran high. Silvas&#8217; counsel
        permitted the county attorney to call for the dismissal of the jury.
        The county attorney pushed the Martinez case because, for the mo&shy;ment,
        the evidence against him was more complete.</p>
      <p> I left immediately for Sari, Sonora, where the murderous desperadoes
        had divided their loot. I wanted to gather up the loose ends of the case
        to obtain some evidence to substantiate Martinez&#8217;s oral confession
        which I felt sure he would repudiate at the trial. I found the camp site
        where Martinez said it was. The most important evidence I found there
        was a book of money orders taken from the Ruby post office. This clinched
        the confession.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Guilty Of Murder</p>
      <p>On May 16. 1922, Martinez pleaded not guilty in the Santa Cruz county
        Superior Court, but there could be but one conclusion, because despite
        the de&shy;fendant&#8217;s frantic denials and his numer&shy;ous alibi
        witnesses, the state had the testimony of the two Mexican women and there
        was the horrible truth told by Irene and Elizabeth on the stand. On May
        18, after deliberating only forty minutes. The twelve jurors found Mar&shy;tinez
        guilty of murder in the first degree without recommendation of mercy.</p>
      <p>That night I went to his cell in the presence of witnesses to get him
        to aid the prosecution in the Silvas trial which was scheduled to start
        the next morning. Although he had confessed to me that Silvas was his
        partner, he had since maintained a sullen silence as to the identity
        of his companion.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Silvas told me where you were hid&shy;ing,&#8221; I began, hoping
        to start him talk&shy;ing.</p>
      <p>He shot a furtive glance ever his shoulder as though half&#8217; expecting
        to meet the accusing eyes of one of those he murdered.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Why not tell us who was with you?&#8221; I urged.</p>
      <p>His black eyes snapped but he did not speak. I clung doggedly to the
        interrogation and finally aroused his anger when I continued to dwell
        upon the fact that Silvas had not attempted to help him.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Si,&#8221; he said finally, &#8220;We were to&shy;gether. We
        kill many gringos in the hills for their money.</p>
      <p>He recounted a list of their depreda&shy;tions along the Arizona border
        which amazed the county attorney. After he had finished he became calm
        and with a more satisfied look upon his face said, &#8220;Maybe now Dios
        will let me sleep.&#8221;</p>
      <p>The Silvas trial was started on May 19. The defense placed its strength
        in character and alibi witnesses. - Martinez&#8217;s testimony came like
        a bombshell. He de&shy;clared that Silvas had been his partner in crime
        for several years, that he had always claimed his share of the loot and
        what was more important still that he had fired one of the shots at Pearson.</p>
      <p>The jury was unable to reach a decision. The balloting was reported
        to have shown eleven for conviction and one for acquittal from the very
        start. The jurors were dismissed and another trial ordered for Silvas.</p>
      <p>This third trial lasted twenty-one days and went on record as the longest
        criminal trial ever held in Santa Cruz County. After hours of battling,
        during which the ballots showed eleven for conviction and one for acquittal,
        Silvas was found guilty of murder, in the first degree with recommendation
        of mercy.</p>
      <p>On July 12, Martinez and Silvas ap&shy;peared in the courtroom for sentencing.
        For their complicity in the Ruby post office atrocity, Martinez was sentenced
        to be hanged on August 18, 1922, while Silvas was sentenced to life imprison&shy;ment
        in the Arizona state penitentiary.</p>
      <p>&#8220;The crimes of which you have been convicted are perhaps the cruelest
        ever committed in Arizona,&#8221; said Judge W.A. O&#8217;Connor. &#8220;Let
        the punishment that awaits you serve as a warning to others who may contemplate
        the commission of similar crimes.&#8221;</p>
      <p>Judge O&#8217;Connor commended the work done by officers and citizens
        in this case and I was awarded $10,000 for bringing the desperadoes to
        justice.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Threaten Jail Delivery</p>
      <p>Now Martinez was a Mexican citizen and there was considerable feeling
        among his countrymen that he should not be executed by this country.
        Then there existed among some classes of un&shy;educated peons a secret
        grudge held against all Americans based on the fear that the United States
        would ultimately conquer Mexico and place its people in servitude.</p>
      <p>By noon a group of friends of the convicted men had gathered in front
        of the county jail. As the day wore on the crowd grew, some of them cursing
        and muttering imprecations. Sheriff White realized an attempt at jail
        delivery would be made and, taking no chances of losing his prisoners,
        he sent for a detachment of U. S. troops from the post. With the appearance
        of the soldiers the crowd melted away and the situation immediately cleared.</p>
      <p>At eleven o&#8217;clock the next night White and Deputy L. A. Smith
        quietly loaded the prisoners into a touring car to take them to the state
        penitentiary at Flor&shy;ence. The late hour was chosen so as to forestall
        any possibility of an ambush. &#8220;Better come along, Oliver,&#8221; White
        invited. &#8220;No,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get some
        sleep.&#8221;</p>
      <p>Noticing that my handcuffs were heavier than White&#8217;s, I suggested
        that he use mine. &#8220;Thanks. I&#8217;ll have the irons back to you
        tomorrow,&#8221; he said as he threw the car in gear and started north
        toward Tucson. Smith sat at his side. The two Mexicans were shackled
        together in the tonneau. &#8220;It&#8217;s raining,&#8221; I remarked
        to a news&shy;paper man who was always on hand.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Yeah, and it&#8217;s the thirteenth of the month,&#8221; he replied</p>
      <p>&#8216;That&#8217;s so, and this is the last of the Ruby drama.</p>
      <p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s not over until Martinez is strung up,&#8221; he
        argued.</p>
      <p>There was no hint of tragedy on that nocturnal ride, yet the warm July
        rain that - pattered down on the car top beat a dirge of death.</p>
      <p>Br-r-r-rug. Br-r-r-rug.</p>
      <p>The telephone was ringing in the Tucson home of Ben Daniels, sheriff
        of Pima county and former Rough Rider with Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
      <p>Muttering to himself he glanced at his watch and saw that it was one
        o&#8217;clock in the morning. Whatever his thoughts were when he jerked
        the receiver down, they faded into oblivion when the speaker&#8217;s
        voice was recognized as that of his deputy, Dave Wilson.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Ben, I just got a call from Canoa Ranch that between there and
        Continental there&#8217;s a car in the ditch and probably trouble.&#8221;</p>
      <p>Daniels was wide awake now.</p>
      <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be right over,&#8221; he shot back, &#8220;Get Lou
        Tremaine, Carmen Mungia and Pat Sheehy and I&#8217;ll pick you up.&#8221;</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Find Scene of Tragedy</p>
      <p> The deputies were standing in front he courthouse when Daniels pulled
        up. After a half-hour of bouncing over rough gravel roads, Daniels stopped
        abruptly. He and his men got out and went over to a wrecked car by the
        side of the road. They shuddered in horror at the spectacle revealed
        by the beam of a flashlight.</p>
      <p>Two bodies lay near each other, sprawled on the ground beside the over&shy;turned
        car. Daniels bent down to get a better view of the blood-covered faces.
        The features of the victims were dis&shy;torted by expressions of horror.
        Their skulls were caved in.</p>
      <p>Daniels jerked erect and gasped in astonishment.</p>
      <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Sheriff White and his deputy. Smith.&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;Smith&#8217;s still breathing,&#8221; someone said.</p>
      <p>But White was dead, his left hand clutching a pair of handcuffs and
        his right lying over a .45 Colt.</p>
      <p>&#8220;This is no accident,&#8221; Daniels de&shy;clared. &#8220;Those
        head wounds are the re&shy;sult of a beating.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Mungia, let&#8217;s get Smith to the hos&shy;pital. The rest
        of you boys wait here. I&#8217;ll get the coroner and notify Nogales.&#8221;</p>
      <p>The shocking news of Sheriff White&#8217;s death was relayed to me and,
        hastily collecting a dozen deputies and a pair of trained dogs, I set
        out for the scene of the tragedy. We were a grimly de&shy;termined group
        for we knew that Silvas and Martinez wire at large again.</p>
      <p>Two hundred feet from the wreck we found the place where the prisoners
        had jumped from the moving car. Nearby was a blood-stained wrench.</p>
      <p>We could visualize the crime. The Mexicans had a wrench-perhaps it had
        been cached in the car by some of their friends. The officers, believing
        their prisoners to be securely manacled, must have relaxed their vigilance.
        There was a short vicious swing with the heavy wrench and the sickening
        crunch of steel upon bone. White was reaching for his gun when he received
        the death blow. &#8216;While the car was still in motion the Mexicans
        leaped out and scrambled away. The car careened to the side of the road
        and turned over, throwing the two officers to the ground in the posi&shy;tion
        they were found.</p>
      <p>The dogs would not take the scent. We believed this to be due to the
        rain which had long since stopped. There was nothing to do hut wait for
        daylight.</p>
      <p>The early light of dawn found us hot on the frail. The tracks told us
        that the men were still handcuffed together and that they were in full
        flight heading east toward Helvetia, - a deserted mining camp in the
        heart of the Santa Rita Mountains; we followed the trail for ten miles
        on foot before we obtained horses. Then the trail led over the mountains
        toward Ruby and we lost it.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Deputy Smith Dies</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Deputy Smith died without regaining consciousness and as
        news of the third double murder spread through the country the rage of
        the people rose. Volunteer posses of of&shy;ficers and civilians poured
        into Con&shy;tinental from Pinal, Pima, Cochise, and Santa Cruz counties
        and they were de&shy;tailed by Daniels to scour the desert and guard
        the roads.</p>
      <p>The warden of the state penitentiary brought the bloodhounds to the
        point where we had lost the trail, but they could not take the scent.
        For the second time dogs refused to help us!</p>
      <p>Harry Saxon, pioneer cattleman whose record as an officer and mountain
        tracker is without equal in Arizona&#8217;s history, was appointed sheriff
        to succeed White. He brought a large volunteer force of dry farmers and
        Indian scouts with him to join in the manhunt</p>
      <p>Five days after the escape there were seven hundred men enlisted on
        perhaps the most extensive manhunt in the his&shy;tory of the entire
        Southwest. There were five days of endless searching under the merciless
        desert sun! With the coming of evening, men gathered in groups and horses
        were hobbled to graze by mem&shy;bers of sweaty, disgruntled posses.
        Sad&shy;dles, saddle bags and blankets were dumped around the campfire.
        The smell of sizzling bacon and boiling coffee filled the air. A mellow
        crescent moon looked down.</p>
      <p>On the morning of the sixth day as the sun rose higher and higher in
        the sky, my men moved steadily south over drifting sand and through blistering
        wind. At high noon I met Harry Saxon. He was resting his horse in the
        shade by a deserted mine.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>&#8220;Just picked this up&#8221; He handed me a blood-stained file.</p>
      <p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve cut the handcuffs, &#8220;I de&shy;clared, &#8220;and
        they must be in this neigh&shy;borhood?</p>
      <p>Saxon was tense as he rode along the canyon&#8217;s edge. Then in the
        foothills of the Tumacacori Mountains his horse sud&shy;denly snorted
        and kicked up his fore&shy;legs.</p>
      <p>Saxon looked curiously ahead. He could discern some object under a stunted
        oak. It was a bloody human foot! He shoved back the brush and peered
        closer. There lay Martinez and Silvas side by side raving with thirst
        and grown reck&shy;less with exhaustion! They had dodged from bush to
        bush over seventy miles of broken country filled with Spanish bay&shy;onet.
        An amazing feat of stamina and endurance.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The End of the Trail</p>
      <p>We flashed the word of Saxon&#8217;s find to the various posses and
        three hours later he and R.Q. Leatherman jogged into Nogales with the
        bruised and slobbering Martinez and Silvas.</p>
      <p>That night Saxon whisked his prison&shy;ers off to the penitentiary
        where Silvas was to spend the rest of his days and Martinez was to be
        hanged on Au&shy;gust 18.</p>
      <p>But on August 18, Martinez was granted a last minute stay of execution
        so that his case could be reviewed by the state Supreme Court. This tribunal
        dismissed the case because of the delay in filing the appeal. The year
        1922 dragged by and 1923 came in. Martinez had been held at the penitentiary
        during all this time. He was now returned to Nogales and Judge O&#8217;Connor
        sentenced him to be hanged on May 23, 1923.</p>
      <p>Martinez still had friends and rela&shy;tives on the outside who worked
        unre&shy;lentingly for commutation of the death sentence. There was the
        formal inter&shy;vention of President Alvero Obregon of Mexico who made
        a plea to Governor George W. P. Hunt to save Martinez because he was
        a Mexican citizen. This bold appeal gave the case an interna&shy;tional
        aspect. But Governor Hunt and the Arizona Board of Pardons and Pa&shy;roles
        refused clemency to the condemned man.</p>
      <p>Exactly twelve hours before execution time the attorneys representing
        Roberto Quiroz, Mexican Consul at Phoenix, ob&shy;tained a writ of habeas
        corpus in Pinal County on the allegation that Martinez was to be executed
        without due process of law.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court intervened, quashed the writ, and declared Pinal County
        in error. But the execution date had passed. Again Judge O&#8217;Connor
        sentenced Mar&shy;tinez to die on August 10, 1923.</p>
      <p>The gray dawn of Friday, August 10, came. Manuel Martinez knelt in silent
        prayer before a priest and received the last rites of his church. For
        the rest of Arizona that dawn gave promise of a bright sunny day but
        for Martinez it was the pay off for his murderous sal&shy;lies in banditry.</p>
      <p>Warden R.S. Sims entered Martinez&#8217;s cell and touched him on the
        shoulder saying, &#8220;It is time.&#8221;</p>
      <p>Martinez heaved a deep sigh, stood erect, whipped off the gay bandana
        from his throat and walked down the corridor to stand squarely over trap.
        He was calm and collected, threw his shoulders hack, brushed his black
        mustachio and the black cap was slipped don over his head. The hemp noose
        was adjusted and the trap was sprung.</p>
      <p>Martinez was dead! He had paid his debt to society and finish was written
        to the Ruby post office enigma.</p>
      <p>Ruby, once drenched in blood1 stamped out the threat of bandit raids
        by pe&shy;titioning the U. S. War Department for protection. Today there
        are mounted U. S. Customs officers and a deputy sheriff there. Prices
        of metals have gone up and Ruby is again one of the liveliest mining
        camps in the Southwest.<br>
