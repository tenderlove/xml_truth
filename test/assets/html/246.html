<p>
<i>Update 2006-01-30. Did a lot of surgery on the Ruby code to make it more idiomatic, based on many good comments I 
received. </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Update 2006-01-30. Note on lines of code comparisons. The example code isn't trying to do a full-on SLOC comparison of the languages, but
you can get a feel for the differences. Ruby and Python are much shorter than Java which is much shorter than C++. However
consider this a very casual comparison because there was not attempt to compress lines of code or make all the comments
equal length etc.
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Update 2006-01-28. I got a lot of good comments on the article and code. I got a lot of suggested improvements, mostly to Ruby and some to Python.
Java didn't get any comments. For C++ I got one that is pretty embarassing but sort of makes a point. My brother and his colleagues pointed out that
I have memory leaks in the C++ code. Oops. The leaks are now fixed. My excuse is that I was writing code in 
'garbage collected mode' and got burned for not mentally switching to 'C++ mode'. </i>

<h1>C++ vs Java vs Python vs Ruby : a first impression</h1>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>
I am a language agnostic journeyman programmer. I am not a fan of a particular language (I almost said 'fanboy') but
thats a bit inflammatory). I just want to write useful programs
and have fun doing it. I know C++ and Java pretty well. I did some beginner work in Python and Ruby. I then
came up with the following conclusions. But before you flame, read the whole article.
</p>
<p><a href="cmpframe.html">Go right to the side-by-side comparison</a></p>

<ul>
<li>C++ vs Java         <br /> Java garbage collection is the big productivity gain <br />Java is significantly slower than C++ <br />C++ is (much) harder to code correctly than any of the others</li>
<li>Java vs Python/Ruby <br /> Python/Ruby interpreted execution and dynamic typing are big productivity gains over Java. <br />Python/Ruby are slower than Java <br />Python/Ruby 
programs need less extraneous scaffolding (cleaner code)
<br />There are two important tradeoffs : [interpreted vs. compiled] and [static vs. dynamic typing] </li>
<li>Python vs. Ruby     <br /> nearly equivalent</li>
</ul>

<h3>intro</h3>
<p>                    
When running various distributions of Linux, I always ran into the choice of KDE or GNOME. There are plenty of
advocates on both sides, but there was no overriding authority. Then recently Linus Torvalds came out with a 
definitive opinion. He took the unequivocal position that
KDE is best. Not that he is necessarily the final arbiter of user interfaces, but at least he provides a strong
datapoint, and since he is smarter than me and since all the other opinions seem to come from biased sources, I
can now pick KDE and feel better about it. Paraphrasing the old IBM criteria, 'no one was ever fired for following 
a Linus directive'. Heh, after all that it turned out that I wanted to use Ubuntu which works best with GNOME so
I ended up with that for now. So 'most practical' won out over 'best'. 
</p><p>
In the meantime I realized I needed to learn a new language and the current buzz is Python and Ruby. 
Again I couldn't find a definitive answer of which one is best. From all the buzz, 
I came up with a vague impression that Ruby is more pure and
is set to win in the long run, but that Python is currently more practical for now. And Google uses Python, which 
is a significant datapoint. They aren't idiots over there.
</p><p>
To see what I could figure out myself, I decided to code up something in Java, then port it to Python and Ruby and 
see how I felt about each, and try to identify where the big wins are for each language.
</p><p>
One caveat. If something significant is missing from a language, like garbage collection, then I don't 
want to hear a response that says
"well, if you use XYZ unsupported library, or you do ABC convoluted technique, then you can do the
same thing in [put language name here]". I am trying to evaluate the STANDARD here, since of course you
can probably do anything in any language including assembler if you work hard enough. And the problem with using a nonstandard
library is not just the extra integration work, it's that you are basing your code on something that may
fall by the wayside later on and then you are stuck. Sometimes it's worth it but that has to be proven
on a case-by-case basis as far as I am concerned.
</p><p>
<h3>history</h3>
<p>
I started in C in 1985, learned C++ in 1990 (Zortech C++) and have been using it ever since. I learned Java 
in the mid-90's when it was first coming out, and found three big  win's for Java over C++: Garbage collection, 
portability and simplicity.  Garbage collection and simplicity created big productivity gains, and portability
is portability. Not having done a garbage collected language before, the productivity gain was readily apparent. 
The simplicity of Java over C++ was really nice. When coding C++, I needed Meyer's Effective C++ on my desk 
at all times 
to be sure I wasn't invoking some weird type coercion or copy constructor/assignment operator anomaly.  And don't
even start with templates. With
Java I never needed that because it is just simpler. 
And the Java libraries were more comprehensive and string handling was easier. So in general I was more productive coding
away in Java. I still liked C++ but it seems that when programming C++, the fun is in figuring out the language and library
, like solving a puzzle. That leaves less time to spend on solving the application domain problem.
</p>
<h3>the code</h3>
<p>
The attached code samples are implementations of a Red-Black tree algorithm adapted from descriptions in
"Algorithms in C++", Sedgewick and "Introduction To Algorithms",Cormen/Leiserson/Rivest. I picked this
because it was short but had some complexity. 
</p>
<p>
code notes and disclaimers:
<ul>
<li>commenting is sparser than usual to avoid obscuring code</li>
<li>I probably made some convention errors in Python and Ruby due to ignorance of the proper idioms</li>
<li>all these programs compile and/or run without warnings and output the same result</li>
<li>I believe the programs to be correct. there may be bugs but if so they are in all 3 versions</li>

<h3>porting</h3>
<p>
It was surprisingly easy to port the Java code to Python and then port the Python to Ruby. A lot of it was regular
expression search and replace, getting some naming conventions right and adapting to a few language differences. 
During the porting process, the two big gotchas I ran into were Python block indenting errors and Ruby's horrible
compiler diagnostics. 
</p>
<p>Porting the Java code to C++ was much more a hassle. I attempted to make use of as much static type checking
mechanisms as I could. In Java I used generics for the tree, and in C++ I used templates for the container and
'const' where appropriate. The big gotchas on porting to C++ were:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The dichotomy between primitive types and objects in C++ is much more pronounced even than Java (and Java is worse off
than Python or Ruby). This dichotomy makes it hard to write a class that supports both primitives and objects. My
implementation might need some fixups to work with objects rather than 'int'.</li>
<li>Java,Ruby and Python all use a consistent reference only scheme to refer to objects which are always on the heap
or equivalent. In C++, you can have a statically
declared objects, a pointer to an object, or a reference to an object, each with features and limitations. A C++ 'reference' is
not the same thing as a reference in the other languages. C++ really wants you to use pointers. These alternatives means that
when you write something in C++ you have to come up with a consistent strategy for using the 3 types of object access, and your
strategy might not be the same as what others prefer. There
is 'more than one way to do it'.
</li>
<li>The lack of built-in mechanisms or even just conventions for operations that should be common across types means
you have to make things up. Like converting a type to string representation. All the other languages have support of one
kind or another but in C++ you have to make up your own convention</li>
<li>Maybe its just me, but C++ always leaves you wondering what you might have done wrong. Its hard to tell. If you read Meyer's Effective C++
you see that there are numerous detailed infrastructure things like constructors and assignment operators that you have to get exactly right or things fail 
at runtime. C++ is really hard to get right, and I never feel totally secure that I did it properly</li>
</ul>
In my opinion (and I have written a lot of C++), use C++ only where you have to for compatibility or performance reasons, or where you arbitrarily decide that
you would rather use C++ because its more fun because its harder. As Tom Cargill (a noted C++ guy) said,
<i>"If you think C++ is not overly complicated, just what is a protected abstract virtual base pure virtual private destructor and when was the last time you needed one?".</i></p>

<h4>python block indenting</h4>
<p>
It took me a while to get my editor (JEdit) happy with Python and getting to not use tabs. Fortunately 
I never screwed up the file so bad that the code didn't work but I always had an unpleasant uncertainty 
about the indentation simmering in the background. Some (or all) of this may be prejudice. I really liked braces better
than either Ruby Do-End or Python indenting, at least when I was coding. On the other hand, a properly indented Python file looks much much
cleaner and is easier to read than any of the others because you don't need all the block closing symbols. However
the explicit 'self' argument makes it look less clean than it could.
</p>

<h4>ruby syntax errors</h4>
<p>
Many of the compiler diagnostics I got during the Ruby porting simply said "syntax error" and gave the line number for
the last line in the file. Great. I spent a lot of time doing binary searches on my code to find the error source.
</p>

<h4>The visitor pattern</h4>
<p>One thing I did differently in each language was try to adapt a 'Visitor' pattern (for traversing the tree) to 
the preferred idiom for each language. You could of course simply code up a Visitor class that is nearly identical 
for each language, but instead I did the following. </p>
<ul>
<li>    Java   : one scheme  : an anonymous class implementing  a predefined interface.</li>
<li>    Python : two schemes : a named class similar to Java and just a named function passed in as a parameter.</li>
<li>    Ruby   : two schemes : a lamba anonymous function, and a Ruby block implementation</li>
</ul>    
<p>
The Java and C++ approaches give you static type checking but takes a lot more cruft to get going. 
I found the Python named function parameter very convenient. But it doesn't carry any state so if you
need state then you use a class. Surprisingly, I found the Ruby lambda easier to 
understand and implement than the Ruby 'block'. That is because my traversal algorithm is recursive, and the lambda
just gets passed around as a parameter (like the python named function parameter). I didn't exploit the
full potential of a lambda closure.
</p><p>
The Ruby block scheme (pun not intended) requires some tricky syntax in the recursive calls, and
I could not find a good explanation of how to handle recursive use of blocks in the Ruby documentation. I found
a single web hit with an example and after fiddling with it I got it to work. I think I understand them now but it is still a bit
fuzzy. I mean, I know what to do now but it takes some concentration to figure out what exactly is happening and why
the code looks like it does. I found that viewing a Ruby block as a co-routine (per the documentation) and not as a subroutine to be the best way
to understand the whole thing.
</p><p>
All that said about the Visitors, I am a Python/Ruby novice so possibly I did things the hard way :)
</p>
<h3>interpreted vs. compiled</h3>
<p>There has always been this tradeoff. In fact, the Python/Ruby vs. Java performance controversy sounds a lot like the C/Assembler/Forth
discussions in the embedded systems world of the early 1980's. Forth was interpreted, it didn't need a compile cycle and it had (supposedly) 
productivity enhancing features that C didn't have. Development cycles were much shorter with Forth. Performance was
not as fast as C or assembler but was close. The drawback of Forth was the weirdness of the language. C won out and Forth
went to the dark corner of mostly forgotten languages. </p>
<p>Interpreted languages give you a much quicker development cycle, especially on big programs. There is no doubting that.
Its simply a tradeoff of execution speed vs. productivity. Some applications need the speed. 
I think it is a premature optimization to say the "I like C/Java better than Python/Ruby because they execute faster".
Interpreted is better if you can get it. When I was testing the code I experienced the advantage of interpreted. I 
didn't really measure performance but other sources show the differences. But since Python/Ruby seem to interface to C/C++ pretty readily, I would be very 
comfortable working in the interpreted world and descending into the netherworld of compiled C/C++ when required. Yes, Python
is actually compiled for a VM but you don't have an explicit compile operation so it acts to the user like an 
interpreted language.
</p>
<h3>static vs. dynamic type checking</h3>
<p>Ok, I like the productivity increase provided by dynamic typing because it eliminates a lot of scaffolding. I found
it quite interesting to see errors pop out at runtime that would normally be compile time in C++/Java. These runtime errors were 
obviously influenced by the paths taken in the test program (or how far it got before it barfed). For a given run, 
I clearly wasn't seeing all the instances of this class of errors as I would have with static type checking. 
</p><p>
Coming from a statically typed language background, my gut says that dynamic typing creates a risk. The Python/Ruby bloggers say that if you 
just unit test properly, then there is no problem. <a href="http://www.mindview.net/WebLog/log-0025">Brucke Eckel has a well reasoned
essay on the issue</a>. I would argue that expecting unit test to catch typing errors has two issues:
</p>
<ul>
<li>in a really big system, its hard to test exhaustively</li>
<li>testing for type correctness makes the programmer do the work that a computer could do</li>
</ul>
<p>
We static typers may be wrong. I had a similar experience moving from PVCS to <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion version control</a>. Oh, My, God,
no locking? The code will be completely ruined in a week. But it turned out to be a non-issue and Subversion added
so much less friction to the development cycle that productivity was improved maybe 10%. The collective good experience overrode the 
predjudice based theoretical 'proof'. The same argument can be made for dynamic vs. static typing. 
</p><p>
I wouldn't mind a separate 'lint' tool for Python/Ruby (is it possible?). I use lint for C/C++ religiously. The whole 
compiled language community is moving towards more static type checking (Java Generics, for example) rather than
less. Are they all idiots? (don't answer that)</p>
<p>My conclusion is that dynamic 'duck' typing is more productive, more pleasant, gives cleaner looking code but it incurs a risk that you 
will get a runtime type exception in your application at some later date. The risk is there, quit denying it. </p>

<h3>the results</h3>
<p>These results are meant to cover issues I noticed in the porting/testing I did. Not an overall evaluation. If I
mention stuff that I didn't run into first hand, then throw that out.</p>

<h4>C++ vs Java</h4>
<ol>
<li>Garbage collection is THE big win for Java.</li>
<li>Java simplicity over C++ complexity is a big win for Java.</li>
<li>C++ is much harder to write and get right than Java or any of the other choices</li>
<li>C/C++ is way faster than Java</li>
<li>Language scaffolding requirements are similar for both</li>
<li>C/C++ is the only way to go for low level systems programming.</li>
</ol>
    
<h4>Java vs Python/Ruby</h4>
<ol>
<li>interpreted vs. compiled is a big productivity win for Python/Ruby</li>
<li>dynamic typing is a big productivity win for Python/Ruby</li>
<li>Java is way faster than Python or Ruby</li>
<li>minimal scaffolding is a big productivity win for Python/Ruby.  Makes programming more pleasant not to have to build all the infrastructure.</li>
<li>mostly first class functions a big win for Python/Ruby. </li>
<li>built-in lists/arrays and hashes/dictionaries a big win over Java [] and library based collections. Java 5.0 fixes some of this but
in Java collections still seem tacked on rather than integrated.</li>
<li>dynamic code loading in Python/Ruby is a big win. Yes you can do it in Java but again, the cruft.</li>
<li>Ruby OO completeness over Java dichotomy between primitive types vs. objects is a big win for Ruby, less so for Python.</li>
<li>There is some weirdness in Python and Ruby lexical scoping of names. The documentation for each has several
warnings about edge cases where names don't bind in the expected way. This gives me a queasy feeling although in
practice it may not matter. Another win for static type checking.</li>
<li>Java 'Comparable' interface ugly compared to Python/Ruby built in comparison mechanisms that require only that
a single function be implemented to get the full set of comparison operators. An example of excess Java
scaffolding.</li>
<li>lack of multiline comments  in Python/Ruby was annoying</li>
</ol>
<bold>TRADEOFFS</bold>
<ol>
<li>static typing is a correctness win for Java, especially with Generics in 5.0. The C++/Java trend is toward stronger static type checking, not less</li>
<li>dynamic typing is a productivity win for Python/Ruby at the cost of some risk</li>
<li>interpreted vs. compiled trades off execution speed for shorter development cycles.</li>
</ol>        
        
<h4>Python vs Ruby</h4>
<p>none of these are that important</p>
<bold> PYTHON WINS</bold>
<ol>
<li>Ruby's compiler/runtime error messages were mostly 'syntax error' with no help. in many cases almost useless</li>
<li>Why does Ruby use rescue/ensure when the rest of the world has settled on try/catch/finally? I mean, its an arbitrary
choice so why not follow the general convention?</li>
<li>Once the indentation is correct, a Python program is the cleanest looking</li>
</ol>
<bold>RUBY WINS</bold>
<ol>
<li>somewhat uneasy over Python indenting vs. Ruby explicit 'end'. probably a predjudice.</li>
<li>Python requirement for explicit 'self' parameter to methods and instance variable access is very annoying</li>
<li>Ruby OO completeness is a win over Python.</li>
</ol>
<bold> EQUIVALENT</bold>
<ol>
<li>Ruby blocks/lambda/yield seemed more or less equivalent (to me) to Python's named class or function. Didn't seem
a big win to be able to write an anonymous function inline. In fact, one could argue that anonymous
classes/functions/lambdas reduce testability because they can't be tested independently of the containing code. But on
the other hand I wasn't using lambdas in the most complete sense, in which they can act on the containing environment
in a way that a named function can't.</li>

</ol>
        
<p>A final thought on C++. To me the C++ Standard Template Library is distinguished from the other language libraries
in that it seems to be much more mathematically thought out. 
The containers and algorithms in the STL all have explicit runtime complexity guarantees. There seems
to be much more computer science in the STL than in the other language libraries. Java is sort of like that, whereas Ruby
and Python libraries seem much more ad-hoc. That probably has a lot to do with their open community driven 
approach to libraries. I really like how the STL was thought out and designed.
</p>

<h3>conclusion</h3>
<p>
Java is more productive than C/C++. Use C/C++ only when speed or bare metal access is called for.
Python/Ruby is more productive than Java and more pleasant to code in.
There is a big question on static vs. dynamic typing. I contend that static typing has to be better
for the purposes of program correctness, but the required cruft reduces productivity. If actual practice in large
systems shows that in fact runtime typing errors don't occur often and are worth the productivity tradeoff, then I will
bow to dynamic typing.
I can't come up with a definitive answer to Python vs. Ruby. They seem very equivalent. Would choose based on practicality 
in a given situation. My general feeling was that Python annoyed me in ways that Ruby didn't, but I think those
annoyances would disappear if I was using Python all the time. 
</p>
<p>Crap, the whole point was to pick Python or Ruby, but I am back where I started.
