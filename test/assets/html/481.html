	<p>The second annual Lone Star Ruby Conference is heating up and right
around the corner, running for three days, September 4-6 in Austin, TX.
This year LSRC offers a full day of advanced training on Thursday in
addition to the two days of Ruby-packed, dual-tract speaking sessions
on Friday and Saturday.</p>


	<p>And as if that wasn&#8217;t enough, the author of Ruby, Yukihiro Matsumoto 
(a.k.a. Matz),
will be keynoting the conference. This is your opportunity to hear
from the author of Ruby, to ask him questions, and to hang out for
a few days with one of the greatest language designers around.</p>


	<h3>Rails or Ruby?</h3>


	<p>The Lone Star Ruby Conference is dedicated to promoting and teaching
Ruby. If you are interested in Web or GUI frameworks, Databases or
Embedded Applications, if it involves Ruby, then you may find it
at LSRC. LSRC is dedicated to bringing you the best of what the Ruby
community has to offer. So, don&#8217;t be surprised if you see Merb talks
right next to talks on Rails and Waves.</p>


	<p>Below is a sampling of the eclectic mix of topics covered at
LSRC 2008:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>The Next Ruby</li>
		<li>Ruby Best Practice Patterns</li>
		<li>Tactical Design</li>
		<li>Javascript frameworks with Ruby</li>
		<li>Creating Desktop Applications with Ruby on Mac OS X</li>
		<li>Building and Managing a Ruby Infrastructure</li>
		<li><a href="/program.html">And more&#8230;</a></li>
	</ul>
