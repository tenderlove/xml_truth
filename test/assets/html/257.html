<h1>Our Story</h1>
<p>Established in Potrero Hill in 2002, Ruby Wine quickly became the neighborhood destination for fabulous wines and personable service. From everyday wines to those reserved for special occasions, our emphasis is on small producers from Old World countries like France, Italy, and Spain to New World wines from California and Oregon.</p> 
<p>Ruby Wine also stocks a keen selection of champagnes, dessert wines, Belgian ales, and domestic microbrews. We also carry wine accessories from Chateau Laguiole and Riedel and a nice assortment of artisan chocolates by Poco Dolce, Theo, Recchiuti Confections, and Vosges.</p><br />

<h1>Tasting</h1>
<p>Don't know a Priorat form a Patrimonio? Come and check out our informal wine tastings. Each week we will offer something different but the theme will always be the same; providing unique wines in an ever-changing format: local wine makers, flights of new releases, and food and wine pairings. Whatever the format, our tastings will be a great way to expand your wine knowledge in a friendly, informal setting.</p>
<p>All attitudes must be checked at the door!</p>
<p>Please call 415.401.7708 for an up-to-date tasting schedule.</p><br />

<h1>The Wine Club</h1>
<p>Each week, after tasting many new wines, we select only the finest to offer at Ruby Wine. From our carefully curated collection, we will choose two (or four) particularly amazing bottles to share with you each month. We choose these wines because they are not only great values, delicious, and produced by some pre-eminent winemakers of the world; but, also because these are the wines we love to drink ourselves. These wines you will certainly be reading or hearing about long after enjoying them.</p>
<p>To fully appreciate the wine, we will include the complete story behind it; from the vineyards to the winemakers and other interesting tidbits. This information paired with the tasting experience makes for a fun, affordable way to expand your wine knowledge.</p>
<p>Choose between two (or four) bottles each month: red, white, or both. A pair for $40 or four for $72. It is a fantastic deal on some fantastic wines.</p>

<h1>Not into commitments? </h1>
<p>You are free to opt out at any time, but we are sure you won't want to. Sign up for the wine club <a href="#" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('wine_club.html','wineclub','menubar=yes,width=700,height=400')">on-line</a> or call us at (415) 401-7708.</p><br />
