          HUNTER-GAULT: On November 14, 1960, the nation watched as six-year-old 
          Ruby Nell Bridges walked into William Frantz Elementary School and into 
          history. A federal court ordered the New Orleans school system to desegregate, 
          making Bridges the first African-American to attend the elementary school. 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: That first morning I remember mom saying as I got 
          dressed in my new outfit, "Now, I want you to behave yourself today, 
          Ruby, and don't be afraid. There might be a lot of people outside this 
          new school, but I'll be with you." That conversation was the full extent 
          of preparing me for what was to come. 
        <P><img width=120 height=131 align=right src="/newshour/images/race_relations/jan-july97/ruby3.gif" alt="Ruby Bridges">CHARLAYNE 
          HUNTER-GAULT: Her walk inspired the 1964 Norman Rockwell painting "The 
          Problem We All Live With," a small black girl escorted by four federal 
          marshals walking to school beside a wall bearing a scrawled racial epithet 
          and the letters KKK. Harvard psychiatry Professor Robert Coles witnessed 
          the scene in New Orleans. He has written a children's book about Ruby 
          Bridges' experience called "The Story of Ruby Bridges." In the book 
          Coles reminds children of the heroism of Bridges' action, showing her 
          facing an empty classroom because angry parents kept their children 
          home and all but one teacher refused to teach a black child. Today in 
          Washington U.S. Marshals honored Ruby Bridges Hall at a ceremony celebrating 
          Black History Month. One of the marshals who accompanied her 36 years 
          ago remembered that day. 
        <P><img width=130 height=112 align=left src="/newshour/images/race_relations/jan-july97/ruby5.gif" alt="Ruby Bridges">CHARLES 
          BURKS, U.S. Marshal (Ret.): We expected a lot of trouble, but, as it 
          turned out, it wasn't nearly as bad as we thought, even though Miss 
          Bridges probably thought it was. For a little girl six years old going 
          into a strange school with four strange deputy marshals, a place she 
          had never been before, she showed a lot of courage. She never cried. 
          She didn't whimper. She just marched along like a little soldier. And 
          we're all very proud of her. (applause) 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And Ruby Bridges Hall, in turn, thanked the 
          marshals. 
        <P><img width=130 height=110 align=right src="/newshour/images/race_relations/jan-july97/ruby6.gif" alt="Ruby Bridges">RUBY 
          BRIDGES HALL: I wish there were enough marshals to walk with every child 
          as they faced the hatred and racism today, and to support, encourage 
          them the way these federal marshals did for me. I know there aren't 
          enough of you, but I do hope that I have inspired some of you today 
          to join me again by dedicating yourselves to not just protecting but 
          uplifting those you touch because that will enable us to rise together 
          as a people, as a nation, and as a world. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Here with us now is Ruby Bridges Hall, and 
          welcome. You were six years old when you went into that school. Did 
          you have any idea at that age what you were getting into? 
        <P><IMG width=135 height=103 align=left SRC="/newshour/images/race_relations/jan-july97/ruby14.gif" alt="Ruby Bridges">RUBY 
          BRIDGES HALL: No, I really didn't. I remember that morning my mom saying 
          to me, "Ruby, you're going to a new school today. I want you to behave." 
          I remember the federal marshals driving up in the car and us being in 
          the car driving to the school. I also remember the conversation that 
          was going on in the car. Federal marshals were explaining to us how 
          we should get out of the car and how to walk once we arrived in front 
          of the school. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Did they tell you there'd be nasty people there, 
          or-- 
        <P><img width=135 height=102 align=right src="/newshour/images/race_relations/jan-july97/ruby11.gif" alt="Ruby Bridges">RUBY 
          BRIDGES HALL: Oh, no, not at all. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Nobody prepared you for that? 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: No. And I kind of feel like that was a good thing 
          because it's--it would have been very frightening for me as a six-year-old 
          to hear what I might actually see once I got there. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: It would loom large in your imagination. 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: Yes. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And yet when you confronted it and saw it, 
          do you remember your reaction? 
        <P><IMG width=125 height=113 align=left SRC="/newshour/images/race_relations/jan-july97/ruby8.gif" alt="Ruby Bridges">RUBY 
          BRIDGES HALL: Driving up I could see the crowd, but living in New Orleans, 
          I actually thought it was Mardi Gras. There was a large crowd of people 
          outside of the school. They were throwing things and shouting, and that 
          sort of goes on in New Orleans at Mardi Gras. I really didn't realize 
          until I got into the school that something else was going on. Angry 
          parents at that point rushed in and took their kids out of school. And 
          my mother and I sat in-- 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You mean, you sat there as they paraded the 
          other kids out of the school. You saw that? 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: Yes. And I didn't quite understand what was going 
          on, but they seemed very upset, and they were shouting, and pointing 
          at us because we were sitting behind some glass doors. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You and your mother? 
        <P><img width=125 height=109 align=right src="/newshour/images/race_relations/jan-july97/ruby7.gif" alt="Ruby Bridges">RUBY 
          BRIDGES HALL: My mother and I in the principal's office. And we sat 
          there all day because we were not able to go to class because all of 
          this was going on. So I actually didn't attend class until the very 
          next day. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And what happened then? 
        <P><img width=145 height=117 align=left src="/newshour/images/race_relations/jan-july97/ruby4.gif" alt="Ruby Bridges">RUBY 
          BRIDGES HALL: The very next day upon arriving at the school the federal 
          marshals escorted me to my classroom, and once I got there, the teacher 
          was there. There were all these desks and no kids. And I actually thought 
          I was early that day. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You thought you were early. 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: I thought I was early. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You mean, you still hadn't grasped the enormity 
          of this and what was going on? 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: Not at all. And actually what had happened is that 
          all the kids were taken out of the school, and the school at that point 
          was boycotted. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: How long did it stay like that? 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: That lasted for over a year. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You went to school every day. 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: Yes. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Tell me about that. 
        <P><IMG width=135 height=112 align=right SRC="/newshour/images/race_relations/jan-july97/ruby15.gif" alt="Ruby Bridges">RUBY 
          BRIDGES HALL: Every day I went to school. My teacher, who was actually 
          from Boston, accepted that job not knowing that the schools were going 
          to be integrated that day. But she taught me, and every day I would 
          arrive. She would greet me, take me to my classroom, and it was just 
          her and I. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And she would teach you as if she were teaching 
          a whole class? 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: Exactly. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Did you come to create a bond between the two 
          of you? 
        <P><IMG width=130 height=105 align=left SRC="/newshour/images/race_relations/jan-july97/ruby13.gif" alt="Ruby Bridges">RUBY 
          BRIDGES HALL: We got to be very, very close. As a matter of fact, I 
          met her again last year. I had not seen her since then, 35 years actually, 
          and I met her, and she said, "You know, it's funny, I just realized 
          that neither one of us ever missed a day of school." And I said, "You're 
          right. I don't know what we would have done." 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: In Bob Coles' book, he writes of that teacher 
          looking out the window, thinking that she saw you one day talking to 
          this mob, but you weren't really. Tell me what was going on. 
        <P><img width=120 height=121 align=right src="/newshour/images/race_relations/jan-july97/ruby10.gif" alt="Ruby Bridges">RUBY 
          BRIDGES HALL: Well, the story is that I prayed. And I don't actually 
          remember that, but it sort of comes from the fact that my mother said 
          to me, "Ruby, if I'm not with you and you're afraid, then always say 
          your prayers." And that's something we were taught. I was raised that 
          way. If I had a nightmare, I would go to her bed at night, and she'd 
          say, "Well, did you say your prayers," and I would say, "No." And she'd 
          say, "Well, that's why you had the nightmare. Go back and get on your 
          knees." And so she said, "If I'm not with you, then say your prayers." 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So you used to say your prayers a few blocks 
          away. 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: Yes. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But this day you forgot. 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: Yes. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Until you got in the middle of the mob. 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: Right. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So you just stopped-- 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: And said my prayers. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: What did you say? 
        <P><img width=130 height=110 align=left src="/newshour/images/race_relations/jan-july97/ruby9.gif" alt="Ruby Bridges">RUBY 
          BRIDGES HALL: I don't actually remember the prayer. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: It's in Bob's book. 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: But I prayed, yes. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: It's quite beautiful. 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: I prayed for the people. That's what I did. And 
          so that was actually--that tells me that I was really afraid because 
          that's when I would say my prayers. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You prayed for those people who were being 
          mean to you? 
        <P><img width=125 height=115 align=right src="/newshour/images/race_relations/jan-july97/ruby12.gif" alt="Ruby Bridges">RUBY 
          BRIDGES HALL: Yes. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: That's pretty amazing. When, if ever, did things 
          get better? 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: Not until much--well, actually better the next year 
          because at that point the school was totally integrated. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So everybody came back? 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: Everybody came back. But later on, it's always important 
          for me to point out that there were some families who actually felt 
          like this was okay, white families, that their kids attend school with 
          a black child. But you have to keep in mind that they also had to cross 
          a picket line to do that. And so there were very, very few people that 
          had the nerve enough to do that, to subject their child to that. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And your own family paid a price, right? 
        <P><IMG width=125 height=113 align=left SRC="/newshour/images/race_relations/jan-july97/ruby8.gif" alt="Ruby Bridges">RUBY 
          BRIDGES HALL: Oh, definitely. My father was always against the idea. 
          He felt like, you know, why subject me to that; just send me to the 
          black school that I had been going to, I could get the same education 
          there. But my mother was very persistent, and she insisted on it and 
          finally convinced him to go through with it. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But he lost his job. 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: He lost his job. He came home one night and said 
          that his boss said that he could no longer keep him there working. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Too much pressure. 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: Because there was too much pressure. Everybody knew 
          that it was his daughter that was going to this white school, and so 
          he had to fire him. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Even your grandparents suffered. 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: My grandparents, who were sharecroppers in Mississippi 
          at the time, had been living there for 25 years on this farm, and they 
          had to leave Mississippi. They then moved to Louisiana, which is where 
          they live now. But even the people that they sharecropped for said that, 
          you know, everybody knows that it's your granddaughter that's in the 
          school, and we're going to have to ask you to leave. 
        <P><img width=135 height=102 align=right src="/newshour/images/race_relations/jan-july97/ruby11.gif" alt="Ruby Bridges">CHARLAYNE 
          HUNTER-GAULT: You talked about the three things that sustained you during 
          that time: prayer, faith was one, your family, and friends. 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: Yes. That was very, very important. I don't think 
          that my parents could have gone through what they did without the whole 
          community coming together. We had friends that would come over and help 
          dress me for school. Even when I rode to school, there was people in 
          the neighborhood that would walk behind the car. I actually didn't live 
          that far from school, and so they would actually just come out and walk 
          to school with me. 
        <P><img width=130 height=105 align=left src="/newshour/images/race_relations/jan-july97/ruby13.gif" alt="Ruby Bridges">CHARLAYNE 
          HUNTER-GAULT: What impact did that experience have on your life? 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: It took me a while to really realize just how important 
          that sacrifice was that my parents made. And having four kids myself, 
          I-- 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Four boys, right? 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: Four boys--I struggled quite a bit trying to raise 
          them, and I soon found out that what I really wanted to do is to work 
          with kids. And something happened in my family. I lost my brother a 
          few years ago. He had four daughters that I took in and started to raise. 
          I then found out that they were sort of raising themselves, and it just 
          hit me that we're not concerned about each other's children anymore. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So your focus today is totally on education? 
        <P><img width=125 height=109 align=right src="/newshour/images/race_relations/jan-july97/ruby7.gif" alt="Ruby Bridges">RUBY 
          BRIDGES HALL: Education, children, and family. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And has the school system changed that much 
          in all those years? I mean, do you still grapple with some of the same 
          problems? 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: Yes. Some of the same problems. The biggest problem, 
          I think, is that parents are not as involved with their children's education 
          as they used to be. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So it's not the racial aspect as much as it 
          is-- 
        <P><IMG width=125 height=113 align=left SRC="/newshour/images/race_relations/jan-july97/ruby8.gif" alt="Ruby Bridges">RUBY 
          BRIDGES HALL: I don't think so. I don't think so. I started the Ruby 
          Bridges Foundation in the hopes of bringing parents back into the schools 
          and taking a more active role in their kids' education. I believe that 
          if I can bring resources into the school that the public school system 
          can do but ultimately what we want as parents is a good education for 
          our kids. It doesn't matter who they sit next to. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well, Ruby Bridges, thank you for joining us, 
          and Bob Coles' book, all the proceeds go to the Ruby Bridges Foundation. 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: Yes.

          HUNTER-GAULT: For that purpose. 
        <P>RUBY BRIDGES HALL: Yes. 
        <P>CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well, all the best.
