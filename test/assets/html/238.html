		<H4>About the Coop</H4> </CENTER> 
	 <P>The Coop was founded in 2001 because at the time, no one offered DSL or
		cable modem Internet access in our neighborhood, and because the voice
		telephone service to the neighborhood is of such poor quality that it was (and
		is) not possible to get modem connections faster than about 26K bits per
		second. The Coop is a <A HREF="sos.htm">Colorado nonprofit corporation</A> and
		is <A HREF="irs.htm">federally tax-exempt under 501(c)(12)</A>.</P> 
	 <P>The Coop's launch of service in 2002 was made possible only by loans
		from "angels," neighborhood residents who chose to lend money to the Coop with
		no assurance the loans would ever be repaid. The Coop reached a milestone in
		the first quarter of 2004 successfully repaying (ahead of schedule, and with
		interest) all of the "angel" loans. The Coop is now debt-free.</P> 
	 <P>The Coop has served its subscribers with two kinds of circuits:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>"line-shared" assymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) circuits,
		  and</LI> 
		<LI>SDSL (symmetric DSL) circuits.</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P><B>The line-shared circuits</B> have used a Qwest unbundled network
		element called a "shared distribution subloop", meaning that we have shared the
		last few hundred feet of a voice line.</P> 
	 <P><B>The</B> <B>SDSL circuits</B> have used a Qwest unbundled network
		element called an "unbundled distribution subloop", meaning that we have rented
		the entirety of a few hundred feet of copper (not shared with voice). These
		subloops are presently priced by Qwest at $24.13 per month. The Colorado Public
		Utility Commission is presently in a ratemaking proceeding in which this
		monthly rate is to be redetermined. The Coop has submitted
		<A HREF="111t/coopcomments.pdf" TARGET="new">comments in this proceeding</A>
		suggesting how the rate ought to be set.</P>
	 <P>In the view of the Coop, $24.13 is ridiculously high for the rental of a
		few hundred feet of a spare copper pair, especially when one considers that
		rental of several miles of copper, plus renting dial tone central office
		facilities, plus retail markups, costs only about $19.00. The Coop has been
		engaged for the past year and a half in futile and time-wasting "negotiations"
		with Qwest in which Qwest repeats, over and over again, that the $24.13 price
		is a "take it or leave it" price. Qwest's view is that supposedly its hands are
		tied. Because there is an SGAT (statement of generally available terms) in
		Colorado, Qwest says it is illegal for it to even discuss, let alone agree to,
		any rate other than the rate set forth in the SGAT.</P>
	 <P>In late 2005, the Coop asked the Colorado PUC to rule upon whether the
		existence of an SGAT relieves Qwest of its duty (under the Telecommunications
		Act of 1996) to negotiate wholesale unbundled network element prices in good
		faith. On March 13, 2006, the PUC <A HREF="20060313-order.pdf"
		TARGET="new">ruled in favor of the Coop and against Qwest</A> on this issue.
		Qwest asked the PUC to reconsider, and on April 26, 2006 the PUC
		<A HREF="20060412-order.pdf" TARGET="new">again ruled in favor of the Coop and
		against Qwest</A>. Qwest asked the PUC to reconsider yet again, and on June 13,
		2006 the PUC <A HREF="C06-0692.pdf" TARGET="new">yet again ruled in favor of
		the Coop and against Qwest</A>.</P>
	 <P>It will be interesting to see if Qwest will now negotiate in good faith
		regarding pricing for the unbundled distribution subloops.</P><HR>
