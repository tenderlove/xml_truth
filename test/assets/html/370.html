<h1>Introducing Ruby</h1>

<p>
Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto was looking for an object oriented scripting
language. Python wasn't OO enough. Perl's "Swiss Army Chainsaw" approach was
too messy. When he didn't find what he was looking for, Matz decided to write
his own language. His goal was to create one good enough to replace Perl. Ruby
was born in February of 1993 and first released to the public in 1995. Today,
Ruby is more popular than Python in Japan. Ruby started hitting the shores of
the United States around 2000.
</p>

<p>
Here's how I think of Ruby. Take Smalltalk, where everything&mdash;even a
number&mdash;is an object. Make it a file-based, interpreted scripting
language. Give it a syntax familiar to Perl and Python users. Add the best
features of many different languages such as regular expressions, iterators,
block closures, garbage collection, and dynamic typing. Abstract many features
into classes like <code>Regexp</code> and mixin modules like
<code>Enumerable</code>. Deliver it with a mature, useful set of library
modules. Finally, add a helpful and responsive developer community. The result
is a language that is easy to learn, powerful, and a joy to use.
</p>

<p>
I've fallen in love with Ruby. It's a pure object oriented scripting language.
It's simple, consistent, and powerful. It stays out of my way and makes me
more productive. Best of all, it comes pre-installed with Jaguar. Open a
terminal window and type <span class="cmd">ruby -v</span>. See? If you aren't
yet running Jaguar, you can download Ruby from the <a
href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby home page</a> and compile and install
it yourself.
</p>

<p>
To attempt to illustrate why I like Ruby so much, let's take a look at the
same class written in Java, Objective-C, Perl, and Ruby. <a
href="#listing1">Listing 1</a> defines a <code>Song</code> class with two
instance variables, accessor (getter and setter) methods, a method that
converts the song to a string for printing, and code to create a
<code>Song</code> object and print it. The Ruby code is smallest and cleanest
(therefore easiest to understand and maintain) without being terse or
obfuscated.

<p>
This article will cover Ruby's language features, syntax, built-in classes,
and libraries. We'll review a few Mac OS X-specific modules, look at some
sample code, and leave you with a list of resources. This isn't a tutorial or
a complete description of Ruby's features and idioms. There are a number of
excellent Ruby books and online resources available that can fill in the
details. See the <a href="#resources">Resources</a> section below for a list.
</p>

<h1>Ruby's Features</h1>

<p>
This section attempts to briefly describe many of Ruby's features. Please bear
in mind that there isn't enough room in this article to list everything or
even fully explain or justify each item.
</p>

<h2>Object Orientation</h2>

<p>
Ruby's object oriented nature is consistent and complete. Everything is an
object or a method. Even numbers are objects and even operators are methods.
You may see code that looks like it is calling a global function; that is
because the top-level code is actually executing within the context of an
invisible magical variable representing the script's main module. This object
includes the <code>Kernel</code> module, giving it access to methods such as
<code>print</code>, <code>chop</code>, <code>system</code>,
<code>sleep</code>, and all the others you might expect from a scripting
language. You can write code that looks procedural, but it really isn't.
</p>

<p>
Classes inherit via single inheritance but can include multiple modules.
Modules provide name spaces and&mdash;unlike Java's interfaces&mdash;method
implementations. Like Smalltalk but unlike C++ or Objective-C, a metaclass
(the class of a class) is a full-blown class itself, with instance variables
and methods.
</p>

<p>
Classes remain "open" so you can add or replace methods for any class at any
time. Go ahead: add a method to the <code>String</code> class! Methods can
also be added to individual objects, giving them unique behavior.
</p>

<p>
Introspection and reflection let objects and classes inspect and manipulate
their instance variables and methods.
</p>

<p>
Mark-and-sweep garbage collection (superior to Python's reference counting
scheme) means you don't have to worry about memory management.
</p>

<h2>The Language</h2>

<p>
Ruby's syntax is simple and consistent. The language has been designed using
the Principle of Least Surprise: things work the way you expect them to, with
very few special cases or exceptions.
</p>

<p>
Variable naming rules are simple. The first character determines a variable's
use: <code>@instance_variable</code>, <code>@@class_variable</code>,
<code>$global</code>, <code>CONSTANT</code>, <code>:symbol</code> and
<code>everything_else</code>. This is different from Perl, where the first
character determines the variable's type. We'll cover variable and method
names in more detail later.
</p>

<p>
Before going any further, let's look at some Ruby code. <a
href="#listing2">Listing 2</a> implements a jukebox full of songs to play.
This version gets its list of songs by reading the names of the files that
iTunes stores in your Music directory. We'll augment this code later by using
the RubyAEOSA module (available separately) to add AppleScript that talks
directly to iTunes.
</p>

<p>
The first line of this script isn't Ruby code; it's a magical incantation that
tells the shell what program to run to execute the script. Instead of
hard-coding the path to the Ruby executable&mdash;which could be in
<code>/usr/bin/ruby</code>, <code>/usr/local/bin/ruby</code>, or even
somewhere else depending upon how it was configured when Ruby was
installed&mdash;we use the env program to figure out where the Ruby executable
lives.
</p>

</pre>

<p>
In Ruby, variables generally hold references to objects. Thus Ruby is strongly
typed but dynamic. Dynamic typing leads to quicker implementation. The benefit
becomes apparent when you decide to change your application's phone numbers
from strings to objects of class <code>MyPhoneNumber</code>. You don't have to
change your code everywhere.
</p>

<p>
Closures are code blocks that remember their context including local variables
declared outside the block, the value of <code>self</code>, and more. They
provide a way to pass snippets of code to iterators or methods. <a
href="#listing3">Listing 3</a> shows a block being passed to an array's
collect method. It also shows that any local variables defined when the block
is created are available to the block.
</p>

<a id="listing3"/>
<pre class="code">
<span class="listing-title">Listing 3: blocks.rb</span>

<span class="listing-summary">
In this example, we create an array and a local variable. We then
call the array's collect method, passing a block that uses the
local variable.
</span>
#! /usr/bin/env ruby

a = [1, 2, 3]
x = 5

# Pass a block to the collect method. The collect method
# calls the block once for each element in the array,
# passing the element to the block. (The method p calls
# its arguments' inspect method, which is defined in the
# Object class but may be overridden.)
b = a.collect { | elem | elem + x }
p a                # prints [1, 2, 3]
p b                # prints [6, 7, 8]
</pre>

<p>
The keyword <code>yield</code>, when used within a method, calls the block
passed to the method. This gives blocks one more nifty use: adding
behind-the-scenes behavior before or after the block is executed. For example,
when the open method of the built-in <code>File</code> class is given a block
argument, it not only passes the opened file into the block but it
automatically closes the file when the block exits. <a
href="#listing4">Listing 4</a> shows how that happens.
</p>

<a id="listing4"/>
<pre class="code">
<span class="listing-title">Listing 4: autoclose.rb</span>

<span class="listing-summary">
This is how the open method of the File class can automatically
close a file for you. It also shows how you specify default method
argument values. The block isn't declared in the method's
signature. It must be the last thing passed in when the method is
called.
</span>
#! /usr/bin/env ruby

# In Ruby, you can add code to any class at any time.
class File

    # The real File.open method is probably a bit more
    # robust than this.
    def File.open(file_name, mode_string = "r", perm = nil)
        f = File.new(file_name, mode_string, perm)
        yield f    # Execute the block, passing the file to it
        f.close()
    end

    # We want to redefine close() but call the original
    # version. We can't just call super() because we are
    # not creating a subclass. Instead, we create a new
    # name for the original version of the method, then
    # use that name inside the redefined method. (This
    # implies that alias_method really clones the method
    # definition instead of simply creating a new name.)
    alias_method :old_close, :close
    def close
        old_close()
        $stdout.puts "file has been closed"
    end

end

File.open(some_file_name) { | f |
    # do something with the file...
}
# "file has been closed" will be printed to stdout.
</pre>

<p>
Traversing a list of values is one of the most common things done in any
program. Ideally, while enumerating the elements of a list you don't care how
many things are in the list or what type of object each thing is. In Ruby,
enumeration has been abstracted into a mixin module available to all classes
and independent of the language syntax. Built-in classes like
<code>Array</code>, <code>Dir</code>, <code>Hash</code>, <code>IO</code>,
<code>Range</code>, and <code>String</code> all mix in (include) the
<code>Enumerable</code> module. If a class includes the
<code>Enumerable</code> module and implements one method called
<code>each</code> that takes a block argument, it gets all the other methods
for free: <code>each_with_index</code>, <code>sort</code>,
<code>collect</code>, <code>detect</code>, <code>reject</code>,
<code>select</code>, <code>entries</code>, <code>find</code>,
<code>grep</code>, <code>include?</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>max</code>,
and more.
</p>

<p>
The <code>Range</code> class represents ranges of integers or strings.
<code>(0..3)</code> is syntactic sugar that creates a <code>Range</code>
object that will generate the values 0, 1, 2, and 3. <code>(0...3)</code> will
generate 0, 1, and 2. Two dots means "include the final value", three dots
means "exclude it".
</p>

<p>
A method's name can be aliased, meaning that more than one name can refer to
the same method. Can't decide between <code>indexes</code> and
<code>indices</code>? Can't remember if it's <code>array.size</code> or
<code>array.length</code>? That's OK: use either one. The built-in classes
make use of aliases to let you decide. We used <code>alias_method</code> in <a
href="#listing2">Listing 2</a> so a song's name could be referred to as its
title.
</p>

<p>
Ruby's exception mechanism is similar to Java's. You can raise exceptions,
rescue (catch) them, and re-throw them. Within the rescue block, if you can
fix the error you can use retry to jump back to the top of the block. See
<a href="#listing5">Listing 5</a> for an example.

<p>
In Ruby, boolean expressions are slightly different than what you are probably
used to: only <code>nil</code> and <code>false</code> are false; everything
else (including the number 0 and empty strings, arrays, and hashes) evaluates
to true.
</p>

<h1>The Rest of the World</h1>

<p>
Ruby is written in C. Not only does this make Ruby reasonably fast, but it
makes integration with existing C code easy. You can extend Ruby with C code
or embed a Ruby interpreter within your C code.
</p>

<p>
Because Ruby is written in C, it has been ported to many different operating
systems. Ruby runs under Mac OS 9 and OS X, BSD, Linux, Solaris, BeOS, OS/2,
DOS, Windows 95/98/NT/2K, and more. Ruby can also load libraries dynamically
on operating systems like Mac OS X that support it.
</p>

<p>
As with most scripting languages, it is easy to execute commands just like you
would from the command line. You can run Unix commands or even launch Mac
applications by using the system method or enclosing the command in
backquotes. The <code>system</code> method runs the command and returns the
exit status; using backquotes returns the output of the command as a string.
</p>

<p>
In the section <a href="#macosx">Ruby and Mac OS X</a> below we will take a
look at some modules that add Apple Event support and Cocoa integration to
Ruby.
</p>

<p>
Ruby is a great language for building Web-based applications. The Web server
built in to OS X is Apache, which can be configured and extended through the
use of modules (not Ruby modules) such as those used to add PHP, Fast CGI,
and&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;Ruby. The Apache module mod_ruby adds support
for Ruby CGI scripts and the eRuby Ruby module adds support for Ruby embedded
into HTML, just like PHP or JSP.
</p>

<p>
Any scripting language used for Web services and page scripting, system
administration, and network communications needs some security measures. For
example, Ruby allows any string to be executed as code using the eval method.
If that string is supplied from someplace outside the script itself such as a
file or user input, it may contain destructive or harmful code. The value of
the global variable <code>$SAFE</code> determines how much Ruby trusts data
stored in its variables. Data is either "tainted" or "untainted". Tainted data
is that which has been supplied externally (for example, use input or file
data). By default (when <code>$SAFE == 0</code>), Ruby trusts all data. Larger
values of <code>$SAFE</code> cause Ruby to disallow the use of tainted data,
prohibit loading programs from unsafe locations, distrust all newly created
objects, or prevent modification of untainted objects. Objects can also be
"frozen" to prevent further changes.
</p>

<p>
Ruby implements operating system-independent threading. The good news is that
the threading model is highly portable; your threads will work under Jaguar or
DOS. The bad news is that Ruby does not yet take advantage of an operating
system's underlying threading, if any.
</p>

<p>
In the next major release of Ruby, Matz plans to add support for
internationalization and multilingualization throughout Ruby. In 1.6.7, the
only internationalization support is via the String class and the kconv
module, which support a small number of codings, including UTF and Kanji.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://jruby.sourceforge.net/">JRuby</a> project is a pure Java
implementation of the Ruby interpreter. A module available at the <a
href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby Application Archive</a> (RAA) provides
integration with Objective-C. See "Ruby and Mac OS X" below.
</p>

<h1>Syntax</h1>

<p>
Ruby's syntax is so close to Perl's and Java's that it won't take long to
learn. I was writing tiny but useful scripts a few hours after installing
Ruby.
</p>

<p>
Each line of code is a new statement. Semicolons are optional and unnecessary
unless you need more than one statement on a line. To continue a line of code
on multiple lines, end the line with something that logically continues the
line: a comma or operator, for example.
</p>

<p>
To create a new object, use <code>thing = ClassName.new(arguments)</code>.
Each class can define the method <code>initialize</code> which is called by
the constructor. You can use <code>attr_accessor</code> and friends to
automatically create accessor methods (setters and getters). See <a
href="#listing6">Listing 6</a> for an example that defines a simple class with
a instance variable definition that uses <code>attr_accessor</code> to
automatically generate accessor methods and another that uses
<code>attr_reader</code> to generate a getter but no setter.
</p>

<a id="listing6"/>
<pre class="code">
<span class="listing-title">Listing 6: constructors.rb</span>

<span class="listing-summary">
An example of constructors and automatically generated accessors.
</span>
#! /usr/bin/env ruby

class MyClass

    # attr_accessor creates setter and getter methods for
    # the listed symbols (instance variable names)
    attr_accessor :name

    # attr_reader creates a getter but not a setter.
    attr_reader :the_answer

    def initialize(name="DefaultName")
        @name = name
        @the_answer = 42
    end

    # The method to_s is like Java's toString() method.
    def to_s
        "My name is #{@name}; the answer is #{@the_answer}."
    end
end

my_thing = MyClass.new("Ruby")
my_thing.name = 'New Name'

# If this line was uncommented, an exception would be
# thrown stating "undefined method `the_answer='"
# my_thing.the_answer = 3

puts my_thing.to_s
</pre>

<p>
As mentioned previously, a variable's use is determined by the first character
of its name: <code>@instance_variable</code>, <code>@@class_variable</code>,
<code>$global</code>, <code>CONSTANT</code>, <code>:symbol</code>, and
<code>everything_else</code>. Note that Ruby class and module names must start
with capital letters. This implies they are constants.
</p>

<p>
By convention, method and variable names are all lowercase and words are
<code>separated_by_underscores</code>. This is not enforced by the parser.
Another convention that may look unfamiliar at first is the use of
<code>?</code> and <code>!</code> in method names. Method names that end with
<code>?</code> return boolean values. Examples include
<code>Object.nil?</code> and <code>Array.empty?</code>. Method names ending
with <code>!</code> modify the receiver. For example,
<code>String.strip</code> returns a new copy of the receiver with leading and
trailing whitespace removed; <code>String.strip!</code> modifies the receiver
by removing leading and trailing whitespace.
</p>

<p>
A <code>Symbol</code> is a unique identifier. All occurrences of the same
symbol share the same instance. Symbols are used to represent method and
instance variable names and can also act as unique values for constants (think
C's enums). Symbols have both string and integer representations.
</p>

<p>
Parentheses around method arguments are optional. Beware, though: leaving them
out can occasionally cause unexpected results. Instead of memorizing complex
rules, do what I do: when in doubt, use parentheses.
</p>

<p>
Arrays are created using either <code>a = Array.new</code> or <code>a = [1,
'foo', thing]</code>. The <code>new</code> method takes two optional
arguments: array size and initial value. Hashes (also called hash maps,
associative arrays, or dictionaries) are created using either <code>h =
Hash.new</code> or <code>h = {'a' => 1, 'b' => 'foo', 'c' => thing}</code>.
The <code>new</code> method takes one optional argument: the default value for
undefined hash keys.
</p>

<p>
String constants can be contained within double or single quotes. When
surrounded by double quotes, the contents of the string are interpolated. All
occurrences of <code>"#{x}"</code> within the string are replaced by the value
of x. Note that x may be anything: a variable, an expression, or an entire
block of code. As a shortcut, <code>"#{$var}"</code> may be written as
<code>"#$var"</code> and <code>"#{@instance_var}"</code> as
<code>"#@instance_var"</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>[]</code> and <code>[]=</code> (assignment) methods of String can
take an integer and return a single character, take two integers (starting
index and length) to return a substring, or even take a regular expression and
return the substring matching that expression. See <a href="#listing7">Listing
7</a> for some examples.
</p>

<p>
One important note: there is no character class in Ruby. When you retrieve a
character from a string you get back its integer value. To retrieve a one
character string you have to ask for a string of length one. See <a
href="#listing7">Listing 7</a>.
</p>

<p>
To write a character constant, use <code>?</code> before the character. For
example, <code>?A</code> is an upper-case A.

<pre class="code">

<span class="listing-summary">

s[/b.*f/] = "z" # s == "xzg"
</pre>

<p>
Ruby's control structures will be familiar to users of most languages. There's
nothing surprising, except perhaps the use of <code>elsif</code> instead of
<code>else if</code>. Like Perl, you can write <code>do_this() if that</code>
or <code>do_that() unless this</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>case</code> structure (called "switch" in Java and C) is
interesting. The branches use the <code>===</code> method to compare the
target with any other kind of object: a number, a regular expression, or even
a class. See <a href="#listing8">Listing 8</a>.
</p>

<a href="#listing9">Listing 9</a> contains some examples of enumerating over

<h1>Classes and Libraries</h1>

<p>
Ruby comes with an impressive and useful library of classes and modules. The
Ruby Application Archive is the best place to find and publish additional Ruby
libraries and applications. When I counted in February of 2003 there were over
800 entries in the archive. They include libraries for Mac OS X, database
access, networking, WWW and CGI programming, XML, unit testing, documentation,
cryptography, AI, graphics, editors, GUI creation, games, and more.
</p>

<h2>Built-In Classes</h2>

<p>
The classes and modules that come with Ruby include value holders
(<code>Array</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>Hash</code>,
<code>Numeric</code>, <code>Range</code>, and <code>Time</code>), I/O classes
(<code>IO</code>, <code>File</code>, and <code>Dir</code>), OO classes
(<code>Object</code>, <code>Class</code>, <code>Module</code>,
<code>Struct</code>, and the <code>ObjectSpace</code> module), operating
system integration classes (<code>Thread</code>, <code>ThreadGroup</code>, and
the <code>Kernel</code> module), regular expression classes
(<code>Regexp</code> and <code>Match</code>), and more.
</p>

<p>
The hierarchy of numeric classes (<code>Numeric</code>, <code>Float</code>,
<code>Fixnum</code>, and <code>Bignum)</code> provides double-precision
floating point and infinite-precision integer arithmetic. The
<code>Math</code> module provides <code>sin</code>, <code>sqrt</code>,
<code>log</code>, and friends.
</p>

<p>
Objects can be marshalled&mdash;converted into byte streams and back&mdash;via
the <code>Marshall</code> module. The library module named <code>drb</code>
(Distributed Ruby) found on the Ruby Application Archive combines this ability
with the networking library to provide an easy-to-use framework for writing
distributed Ruby applications.
</p>

<h2>Libraries</h2>

<p>
The standard Ruby distribution comes with a number of libraries including
networking, XML parsing, date manipulations, persistent object storage, Tk (a
cross-platform GUI infinitely less pretty than Aqua), mutex thread
synchronization, MD5 (cryptography), debugging, matrix math and complex
numbers, design patterns like observer/observable and delegation, OpenGL, and
much more.
</p>

<p>
The standard Ruby libraries are found in <code>/usr/lib/ruby/1.6</code> (or if
you've installed version 1.8 yourself, in <code>/usr/local/lib/ruby/1.8</code>
and used the default install directory). Additional libraries you download and
install usually place themselves in <code>/usr/lib/ruby/site_local/1.6</code>.
</p>

<a id="macosx"/>
<h1>Ruby and Mac OS X</h1>

<p>
Fujimoto Hisakuni has written three Mac OS X Ruby bindings: RubyAEOSA,
RubyCocoa, and an Objective-C binding. They come with plenty of example code.
All three are available within the same package. Download RubyCocoa version
0.3.2 or higher from the RAA. The download is a disk image (".dmg") file
which contains, among other things, a ".pgk" package file. Install the
package and you are ready to use the three libraries. Version 0.3.2 is for
Jaguar only; it won't work with earlier versions of Mac OS X. If you are
running an earlier version, download an earlier version of the libraries and
follow the included installation instructions.
</p>

<p>
RubyAEOSA lets you send create and send Apple Events, run AppleScript code,
and retrieve the results from either. RubyCocoa allows your scripts to use
Cocoa objects. You can even write small Cocoa applications using Ruby and
Interface Builder.
</p>

<p>
Let's use some AppleScript to let the jukebox from <a href="#listing2">Listing
2</a> talk directly to iTunes to retrieve song information and play a song.
See <a href="#listing10">Listing 10</a>. Two warnings: first, this AppleScript
takes a few seconds to execute if you have a lot of music, whether it is run
from Script Editor or this Ruby script. Second, for some reason this
AppleScript code kept trying to launch the OS 9 version of iTunes. I had to
move the OS 9 iTunes folder into the Trash and reboot before it would launch
the OS X version. Even then, it started trying to launch the OS 9 version
after a while. I emptied my trash. I'm no AppleScript expert, so all this was
probably my fault.
