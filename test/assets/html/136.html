His research interests revolve around the application of anthropological insights to the production and comprehension of photographs, film, and television. For the past two decades, he has conducted ethnographic studies of pictorial communication in a rural American community. He was educated at the University of California, Los Angeles, received a B.A. in History [1960], an M.A. [1962], and Ph.D. [1969] in Anthropology. A founding member and past president of the Society for the Anthropology of Visual Communication, past president and trustee of International Film Seminars, Ruby holds advisory and board memberships in a number of national and international organizations and is president of the Center for Visual Communication, a research co-operative. He has held visiting lectureships at the University of Pennsylvania in Landscape Architecture and Regional Planning, Rutgers University in Art, and in Anthropology at the University of California, Davis, the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Princeton University. Ruby co-produced, directed and wrote two award winning ethnographic documentaries, <i>A Country Auction</i> [1984] and <i>Can I Get A Quarter? </i>[1985] and served as consultant, advisor, and researcher on numerous films and television programs. Ruby has curated photographic exhibitions since 1974 including <i>Images of the USA - Three European Photographers</i> [1985], <i>Fragments of </i>A Dream: The Pittsburgh Photographs of W. Eugene Smith [1988] at the Arthur Ross Gallery, Philadelphia;<i>Reflections on Nineteenth Century Pennsylvania Landscape Photography</i> for Lehigh University [1986]; <i>Something To Remember You By: Death and Photography in America </i>at the Southeast Museum of Photography in Daytona Beach [1994]; and <i>Not a Bad Shot: The Photographs of Francis</i> <i>Cooper</i>, Woodmere Gallery, Philadelphia [1996]. In 1968 he founded the Conference on Visual Anthropology, an international event he directed until 1980. Included in his diverse film/video programming experience are the Flaherty Film Seminar, The Arden House Public Television Seminar, and The Annenberg International Conferences on Visual Communication. Ruby has been trained, conducted research, and published extensively in archaeology, popular music, film, television, and photography. Since 1960 he has edited a variety of scholarly and popular journals on American archaeology, popular culture, and visual anthropology including <i>Studies in Visual Communication</i>. and <i>Visual Anthropology .</i> He has edited a number of books including <i>A Crack in the Mirror: Reflexive Perspectives in Anthropology</i> [University of Penn Press, 1981], <i>Robert Flaherty, A Biography </i>[University of Penn Press, 1982], <i>Image Ethics</i> [Oxford University Press, 1988] and<i> Image Ethics in the Digital World</i>.[2003, University of Minnesota Press] both co-edited with Larry Gross and John Katz. His writings have been translated into Spanish, German, Italian, Dutch, Finnish, Japanese, and Estonian. Among his single authored works are </font><a href="http://wsrv.clas.virginia.edu/%7Eds8s/jay/jay.html"><i><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">Secure The Shadow: Death and Photography in America</font></i><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">, </font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">(1995, MIT Press), </font><a href="http://wsrv.clas.virginia.edu/%7Ebhs2u/cooper/cooper.html"><i><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">The Photographic World of Francis Cooper: Not A Bad Shot</font></i><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">,</font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1"> a book length study of Francis Cooper, a nineteenth century Pennsylvanian photographer (1999,Pennsylvania State University Press) and <i>Picturing Culture: Essays on Film and Anthropology (</i>2000, University of Chicago Press).

The ethnographies are distributed by DER of Watertown, MA (www.der.org).

I see the field as more inclusive and complex dealing with all aspects of the visible world from the vantage point afforded by theories of culture and communication. Ethnographic film is a minor branch of the documentary film world and almost totally oriented to television or the classroom. It has marginalized itself from the mainstream of cultural anthropology in part because few ethnographic filmmakers are trained anthropologists and the theoreticians of ethnofilm like Bill Nichols and Trinh T. Minh-ha have a less than adequate knowledge of anthropology. <a href="http://astro.temple.edu/%7Eruby/ruby/nichols.html">See my polemical critique of Bill Nichols' essay, The Ethnographers' Tale.</a></font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">There are two canonical books read by everyone interested in "visual anthropology" - Heider's <i>Ethnographic Film</i>, Hockings' <i>Principles of Visual </i>Anthropology and John Collier's <i>Visual Anthropology</i>. I find these works undertheorized in a way that trivializes the field. Moreover there has been a lack of public debate about their adequacy. I have therefore added my reviews of<a href="http://astro.temple.edu/%7Eruby/ruby/heiderrev.html"> Heider</a>, and <a href="http://astro.temple.edu/%7Eruby/ruby/hockingsrev.html">Hockings</a> to the list of my writings available via the web. Along with Sol Worth and others, I advocate an approach to visual anthropology called the anthropology of visual communication. There are several essays in Worth's <a href="http://astro.temple.edu/%7Eruby/worth/svscom.html">Studying Visual Communication</a> that outlines the stance. I was the director of a graduate program at Temple University where these ideas were explored. Along with my colleagues Bapa Jhala, Niyi Akinasso, and Denise O'Brien, we developed a unique program of graduate studies in the anthropology of visual communinication from 1990 to 2002. If you are interested in exploring how we transformed Worth's concept of an anthropology of visual communication into a Ph.D. program see the following linked articles:</font></p><p><a href="http://astro.temple.edu/%7Eruby/ruby/rubychalfen.html"><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">1974 With R.
