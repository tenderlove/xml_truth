<b><i>"I got what I wanted and then some. 
Just turn it up about half way and sonic nirvana awaits you. 
Classic overdrive with a glassy, liquid shimmer."</i></b> -- Dave Nix<br><br>

<b><i>"Just wanted to tell you how great the express is! I'm so stoked with both of the amps you built for Gary and I."</b></i> -- Sam Cannon<br><br>

<b><i>"I got Gary's amp and unpacked it. Couldn't help but tubin' it up and pluggin' it in. OMG does that thing sound good, I guess you need to make me one of those... Played with a couple of pedals in front of it, man this thing sounds good. If you knew how many amps I have had and still have you would get a hint of what a compliment this is."</b></i> -- Sam Cannon<br><br>

<b><i>"Ava is a spectacular amp. I have a Vox clone, which does not have the 
warmth and smooth clarity of Ava. I took a peek under the hood and see 
that you do great work. If you want me to post a review at the amp garage 
or gear page, let me know. It would be 100% glowing."</b></i> -- Jake<br><br>

<b><i>"I just bought 'Marta' from Speck last night and she sounds amazing!  I wanted to email you and thank you.  One of the reasons that I wanted to buy her, aside from the fact that she may just be the best sounding amp I've ever played besides my '59 Bassman, is that I'd like to try my hand at building my own Express clone and I thought it would be easier if I had one that worked already as a reference."</b></i> -- Andy Harrison<br><br>

<b><i>"With this amp I shall rip the fabric of the space time continuum.
The universe will stop expanding and begin to contract.
Time will run backwards and send all normal man (with no PAUL RUBY amp)
into a primordial like primate state.
With my amp I shall dominate all evil in the universe.
Then I shall step aside and KNEEL before your greatness 
as the SUPREME OMNIPOTENT EVIL OF ALL EVILS!!"</b></i> -- Daniel Bollino<br><br>
