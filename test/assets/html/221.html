	    <h2>No Meeting Tonight Due To Weather</h2>
		<p class="date">February 13, 2007</p>	
		<p>The weather forecast is showing freezing rain starting around 6pm and continuing through the evening. Based on that, I would like to reschedule the meeting to Feb 28th. Erik can't make that date but hopefully we can get him to come and show his work at the March meeting.</p>

<p>So no Ruby Jam tonight! Next meeting Feb 28th 6pm, same location!</p>

	    <h2>11/8 Meeting Summary, Next Meeting 12/13</h2>
		<p class="date">November 15, 2006</p>	
		<p>Our meeting on 11/8 was great! Ed and I worked some more on the Pixel Dust Games framework. I am currently porting an Asteroids clone I wrote in Java over to Ruby, so we worked on that. Jamie Orchard-Hays gave us a nice overview of ActiveResource and Rails 1.2. Chris Hapgood and Eric Pugh contributed greatly to the discussion. I learned a lot and I thank everyone for being willing to share their knowledge. </p>

<p>Our next meeting will be on December 13th. Note we are starting at 6pm next time. In general, our meetings will fall on the second Wednesday of each month. Hope to see you there!</p>

	    <h2>Next Ruby Code Jam 11/8/06</h2>
		<p class="date">October 20, 2006</p>	
		<p>The next Ruby Code Jam meeting will be Wednesday November 8th at 7pm at the Ten Flavors Studio on the downtown mall. This meeting will be more of a code jam than a formal presentation. Please bring your laptop and technologies you want to show off or code that you want to jam on! We will have wireless Internet. Also please drop me a line if you are coming so I can get a headcount for pizza. Directions to the space are <a href="meeting.html">here</a>.</p>

	    <h2>My Ruby Jam Report</h2>
		<p class="date">09:23 AM</p>	
		<p>Thanks to everyone who came out Saturday! It was a good day of hacking 
and it went fast as it always seems to. Present at the event were Keith 
Bennett, Chris Hapgood, Mike Perz, Colin Steele, Ed Zavada, and myself.</p>

<p>We broke into two project teams. One project team worked on Ruby 
bindings for Ed's high performance graphics engine. The second team 
worked on troubleshooting and extending Chris' photo tagging software he 
is porting to the web. Ed, Colin, and Keith worked on the graphics lib 
bindings. I worked on the second team with Mike and Chris.</p>

<p>Chris had taken the app pretty far already and we just sort of picked up 
where he had left off in his own work and started peer programming it. 
We put the code up on a large flat panel and took turns driving the 
keyboard. It was educational to see somebody else's approach to AJAX in 
Rails and to have them right there to explain their code. After a 
summary of the architecture given by Mike, we worked on the first 
problem, completing the round trip on a user interaction he was 
currently coding. It was a somewhat complex user interaction. I 
introduced him to JSON for data transmit and I learned about some very 
useful (some would say basic) tools that I have been overlooking. (like 
the Firefox DOM Inspector!) My life is so much better now. ;^) Also, we 
checked out the MS JS debugging environment. We stopped coding for a 
while and just exhanged knowledge. I introduced the group to Yahoo's UI 
platform. We talked about Web Services with REST. The last problem we 
worked on was tracking down some crazy browser specific bugs in the 
javascript mouse event handling code. Learned lots of in and outs of 
Prototype's mouse handling tools.</p>
