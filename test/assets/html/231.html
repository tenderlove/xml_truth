  in 1862. The Fort was built midway between Salt Lake City, Utah and Carson City, Nevada to
  protect the Overland Mail route (Pony Express) and emigrant travelers from Indian raiders.
  Most Army outposts of this time were built in remote areas, but this post was classified
  by the Army as the &quot;Worst Post in the West.&quot; In 1869 the completion of the
  Transcontinental Railroad brought an end to the <a href="pony_exp.htm">Pony Express,</a>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">In May 1860, Co. B of the 4th Artillery assigned to Camp Floyd, Utah, was
  sent to <a href="../Places/ruby_marsh.htm">Ruby Valley</a> to find and establish a camp base to use
  to protect the Overland Mail Route and its passengers and others from Indian attacks. On
  Sept. 4, 1861, Col. E. P. Connor organized the 3rd Regiment of California Volunteers. A
  year later he received orders to patrol the Central Route of the Overland Mail Company.
  The site chosen for Fort Ruby is on the eastern side of the southern end of the Ruby
  Mountains in Ruby Valley, Nevada. The Fort was situated about 2 1/2 miles southeast of the
  Overland Mail Station on a six square mile plot of ground. The Fort's northern boundary
  was on the dividing line between what are now Elko and White Pine Counties in Nevada. The
  site was approximately midway if the 600 miles separating Carson City, Nevada and Salt
  Lake City, Utah.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Col. Edward P. Connor </strong>and seven companies of soldiers
  (about 600 men), 55 wagons, 2 howitzers, carriages for some of the officer's families, 3
  ambulances and the regimental band departed Camp Halleck, Stockton, California, on July
  12, 1862, and began marching east. They arrived at Fort Ruby on the evening of September
  1, 1862. Fort Ruby was officially established pursuant to orders # 8 dated September 4,
  1862 by Col. Connor.</p>
  <p align="left">Soldiers immediately began to gather stone and timber from the nearby
  mountains to build store houses and winter quarters. Living quarters were log cabins of
  hand hewn logs either laid horizontally or vertically and heated by fireplaces. Stables
  and store houses were built of vertical logs in a stockade fashion with the posts set
  vertically in trenches. Corrals were constructed of adobe. A good sized pond, fed by a
  spring, supplied the Fort with fresh water.</p>

  caulked with adobe, had shingled roofs, 2 brick fireplaces, and 2 double-hung windows in
  each building. When the Fort construction was completed, there were approximately 14 white
  washed log buildings comprising the Army's quarters and several other log cabin
  outbuildings. In 1858, the only two original buildings remaining showed evidence of having
  3&quot; tongue and groove wainscoting in their interiors.</p>

        <p align="left"><strong>Major P. A. Gallagher</strong> served from Oct 1862 to July 1863.
  Dr. R. K. Reed was the first Post Doctor and then Asst. Surgeon Kirkpatrick took over the
  treatment of military and civilian patients at the Fort until 1863. Dr. John W. Long
  served as Post Doctor from 1863 to 1866.</p>
        <p align="left"><strong>Lt. Col. Jeremiah. B. (P.) Moore</strong> served from April 1863
  to Sept 1863 (Co. K 2nd Cav. under command of Capt. Samuel P. Smith. Lt. Col. Moore was
  known to flog soldiers for minor infractions or made them carry heavy sandbags in the hot
  sun until they collapsed from heat exhaustion as punishment. He hung two Indians at this
  post when they were identified as having led the Indians at the Gravelly Ford battle and
  left their bodies hanging to frighten the Indians and keep them in line by using the
  hangings as an example.</p>
        <p align="left">During the Goshute War of 1863, the Overland Mail and Stage Company lost
  150 horses, 7 of their stations were burned to the ground and 16 of their employees were
  killed in Nevada and Utah. Moore stayed in Ruby Valley after mustering out of the Army.</p>
        <p align="left">During the summer of 1864, the two California Volunteer companies
  stationed at Fort Ruby were replaced by a unit of the Nevada Volunteers of Co. B. 1st
  Nevada Infantry. The lessening of manpower made patrolling of the Overland Route much more
  difficult.</p>
        <p align="left"><strong>Capt. G. A. Thurstin</strong> was in charge beginning in the fall
  of 1864 until Dec. 1865. Capt. Thurstin and Dr. John W. Long, the Post Doctor tried to
  cure venereal disease of some of the soldiers and some Indians by constructing stone
  chambers at the hot springs on the Old Myers Ranch above Franklin Lake several miles north
  of Fort Ruby. Patients were required to sit on the stone &quot;pots&quot; and absorb the
  steam from the hot water. These structures could still be seen in 1957.</p>
        <p align="left">Capt. Thurstin wrote to his superiors at Fort Douglas, UT in 1864,
  suggesting that the Indians were stealing to prevent starvation and it would be beneficial
  for the Army to gather the Indians of the area together for a conference. The Army did not
  respond to his idea but the Overland Mail and Stage Company stepped in and told its
  station keepers to provide enough emergency rations to the Indians to keep them from
  starving to death.</p>
        <p align="left"><strong>A Company of 9th U. S. Infantry</strong> was in charge from Dec
  1865 to Sept. 1867. On January 1, 1867, the name of Fort Ruby was changed to Camp Ruby.</p>
        <p align="left"><strong>Capt. George Walker</strong> assumed command Sept. 20, 1867,
  immediately took a six-month long furlough, and died upon his return to the command of the
  Fort of apoplexy about March or April 1868.</p>
        <p align="left"><strong>Lt. J. T. Trout</strong> took over the command when Capt. Walker
  died.</p>
        <p align="left"><strong>Capt. Timothy Connelly</strong> was in command from 1868 to 1869.
  Connelly was the last commanding officer at Fort Ruby. He was found guilty and court
  martialed at Fort (Camp) Halleck on May 20, 1869 for embezzling company funds at Fort
  (Camp) Ruby.</p>
        <p align="left">After 1865, Indian raids became infrequent and in 1869, the Army
  determined that Fort Ruby was no longer necessary. On instructions of Headquarters,
  Department of California, San Francisco, dated July 15, 1869, Fort Ruby was ordered to be
  abandoned. On September 20, 1869, the men of Co. I 9th Infantry and all of their supplies
  were transferred from Fort Ruby to Camp Halleck some seventy miles to the north. </p>
        <p align="left">Most of the abandoned building at Fort Ruby were sold to nearby ranchers.
  Thomas Short of Cave Creek is said to have bought several of the structures and moved them
  off the Fort. Some of the buildings or parts of them may still be being used on ranches
  today. </p>
        <p align="left">Fort Ruby was never declared a military reservation by Executive order. In
  1961, the U. S. Dept. of the Interior gave landmark status to Fort Ruby. Only two original
  buildings, an enlisted men's barracks and the officer's quarters were remaining in 1992
  when they were both lost to history when they were destroyed by a fire.</p>

        <p align="left">Twenty-one or more interments of military men and civilians took place in
  the Fort Ruby Military Cemetery. This cemetery has several sources saying
        it was located one half mile to the north of the Fort on the Old
        Narcissi Ranch. Two graves are fenced and can be seen on the east
        side of the road near a huge spreading willow tree where a road
        leads into the marsh. One source states the cemetery was located
        1/2 mile to the west of the fort.</p>
        <p align="left"> One of the burials
  was likely that of Private or Sergeant John W. Purdy, of Carson City, Nevada, who drowned
  in the lake in the cave at Cave Creek while exploring the cave.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"> Another burial may have
  been that of Post Commander Capt. George Walker who assumed command Sept. 20, 1867,
  immediately took a six-month long furlough, and died upon his return to the command of the
  Fort of apoplexy about March or April 1868.</p>
        <p align="left">A third burial undoubtedly was that of Pvt. Thomas
        Conley who was fatally wounded at Egan Canyon Pony Express Station
        during an Indian squirmish on August 11, 1860.</p>
  <p><font color="#000000">An erroneous local legend persists that the
  three fenced graves in the <a href="../../WP_cemeteries/egan.htm">Egan
  Canyon Cemetery </a>are those of three soldiers killed in a Indian battle
  in 1860.&nbsp;</font>On August 11, 1860, when the Army arrived in time to
  save the lives of the two Egan Station keepers from a large party of
  Indians, during the fight, three soldiers were wounded. According the
  report of Lt Stephen H. Weed <font size="2">(File U-44, Adjutant
  General's Office, Letters Received, Records of the War Dept, National
  Archives, Microfilm # 567, Roll 634)</font>, the three wounded soldiers
  were: Corpl. John Mitchell (shot in the hip, not serious) and Pvts.
  Joseph Henry (shot in the neck, serious) and Thomas Conley (shot through
  the back - serious). On the August 12, 1860, Lt. Weed ordered eight
  soldiers to take the wounded soldiers back to Ft. Ruby where Pvt. Thomas
  Conley died from his wounds. The other two survived their injuries and
  obviously are not buried in the Egan Cemetery.</p>
        <p align="left">The Quartermaster Corps authorized removal of the
  military dead to the Presidio Cemetery in San Francisco, California. Sources conflict on the final disposition of the interments by saying the
  bodies were removed to Fort Halleck, Nevada, to Carson City, Nevada, to the Presidio
  Cemetery in San Francisco, or that they were never moved anywhere and are still resting
  within a mile of the old Fort.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center"><u><b>Soldiers who stayed</b></u></p>
        <p align="left">Several Fort Ruby soldiers remained after being mustered out of the Army
  to settle in Ruby Valley as ranchers and farmers.&nbsp; Some of these Fort Ruby soldiers
  were: <br>
        <strong>Col. Jeremiah P. Moore</strong> settled the present Lourinda R. Wines (Mrs. J. B.)
  Ranch (Buckle D Ranch) after commanding <a href="ft_ruby.htm">Fort Ruby</a> in 1863.<br>
        <strong>William Meyers</strong> settled the present Lloyd Meyer Ranch<br>
        <strong>James Meyers</strong> settled the present James K. Stonier Ranch. This ranch was

&quot;Uncle&quot; Billy Rogers is thought to have erected on the Fort Ruby site just a few
yards to the south of the Fort Ruby Spring. Some say it was built in 1859, while others
say it was built when the Fort was established in 1862. Whatever the correct date or
whoever built it, the fact remains that it is one of the oldest, if not the oldest
structure left in <a href="../Places/ruby_marsh.htm">Ruby Valley</a>. Andy Anderson used the cabin
as a tack room. Today, it is open to be used by cattle and will soon be lost to posterity.</p>
