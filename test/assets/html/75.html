They quickly become accustomed to human presence, and         will swoop down to investigate red articles of clothing, possibly as potential         food sources. Feeders hung at windows attract as many visitors as ones         farther from structures, and the bird that claims a feeder as its territory         may spend much of the day perched nearby, guarding the food source against         intruders. Many hummingbird watchers find &quot;Hummer Warz&quot; endlessly         entertaining, although the chases are obviously serious business to the         hungry birds. For a short period immediately after fledging, a female         will tolerate the presence of her own young at the feeder, but they are         soon treated the same as other adult birds - as rivals in pursuit of the         food necessary to prepare for the fall migration.</p>      <p>Courtship is apparently very brief, if it exists at all, and once mated         the female raises the young alone. The walnut-sized nest, built by the         female, is constructed on a foundation of bud scales attached to a tree         limb with spider silk; lichens camouflage the outside, and the inside         is lined with dandelion, cattail, or thistle down. The nest will stretch         to contain the growing nestlings, and may sometimes be reused (rebuilt)         the following year.</p>      <p>Two white, pea-sized eggs are laid two or three days apart, which the         female will incubate from 60 to 80 percent of the day for 12-16 days.         Reports of the duration of the nestling phase vary from 14 to 31 days,         the wide range possibly varying with the availability of food; 18-23 days         is normal. when they leave the nest, the chicks are considerably larger         than their mothers: they may weigh 4.5 grams, while poor Mom is down to         only 2.5 g after the stress of raising them. Since the mother starts incubating         the first egg as soon as it's laid, that chick will hatch and fledge earlier         than its sibling; it will remain close to the nest until the other chick         is ready to fly. After leaving the nest, fledglings are fed by their mother         for about 10 days. It is thought that Ruby-throats live as long as 12         years, but the average is probably 3-5 years.</p>      <b>Physical Description</b><br>      Average length: 3.5 inches (8.9 cm)<br>      Average weight: 1/8 ounce (3.1 g)<br>      Body temperature: 105&deg;-108&deg;F (40.5&deg;-42.2&deg;C)<br>      Wing beats: 40-80 per second, average about 52<br>      Respiration: 250 per minute<br>      Heart rate: 250 beats/min resting; 1200 beats/min feeding<br>      Flight speed: 30 mph (48 kph) normal; 50 mph (80 kph) escape; 63 mph (101       kph) dive<br>      <p><b>Plumage</b><br>        Adult male: Emerald green back, iridescent ruby red gorget (throat) that         may appear black under some lighting conditions, gray flanks, forked tail         with no white. Smaller than the female.<br>        Adult female: Emerald green back, white breast and throat, rounded tail         with white tips. Larger than the male, with longer bill.<br>        Juveniles: Young of both sexes look like the adult female. In August and         September, young males may develop some red spots in the gorget.<br>        Molts: One complete molt per year, which may start during the fall migration         and continue into March. Young males acquire full ruby gorgets during         their first molt.       <p>Gender identification is simple if the light is right: the brilliant         red gorget of the male is unmistakable. More commonly, though, the shape         and presence of white on the tail is a more reliable field mark.<br>      </p>      <p><b>Distribution and Migration</b><br>        Ruby-throats breed throughout eastern to midwestern North America, from         southern Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Most winter in Mexico, Central         America, and on Caribbean islands, although a few remain in the Gulf states         and the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Most researchers accept a remarkable         non-stop crossing of the Gulf, taking 18-20 hours. They arrive at the         coast in late February or early March, and follow the development of spring         flowers northward, reaching my home in St. Louis on April 20 +/- 2 days.         Males migrate earlier than females, in both directions; some adult males         start south as early as JUly. Our female breeding birds leave here (St.         Louis) in September, with the young of the year following; the last juveniles         depart abruptly at first frost (mid-October). By mid-November the fall         migration is essentially completed throughout North America.</p>      <p>A fanciful and amusing <a href="about.html#piggyback">myth</a> has arisen         regarding hummers hitching rides on other birds.</p>      <p>Sources: Bob and Martha Sargent, <i>Stokes Guide to Bird Beavior</i>,         <i>Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Birds (Eastern Region)</i></p>      <p>For maps showing population distribution and trends, see the USGS <a href="http://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/id/framlst/i4280id.html">species         account</a>.
