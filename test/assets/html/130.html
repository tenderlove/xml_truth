<p>Ruby is an &quot;enhanced&quot; version of the <a href="littlegem.html">Little Gem</a> battery-powered amplifier. The architecture of the Little Gem has been updated with an input buffer (as found in the Little Gem MkII) feeding the inverting input and the volume control changed from the output rheostat to the type and placement as shown in the datasheet application notes.  Additionally, the 5k Gain pot of the Little Gem has been reduced to a 1k, as used in the <a href="grace.html">Grace / Big Daddy</a> circuits.</p>
<p>Ruby has many shades of sparkly clean all the way up to a great, natural
overdrive.  The input buffer helps to retain treble detail going into the
386 chip.  As you increase the Volume, you will start getting nice
breakup.  Where the Little Gem is similar to a &quot;master volume&quot; amplifier, Ruby is more like the &quot;non-master&quot; volume amps.  If
the Little Gem can be considered Marshall-ish, Ruby could be called Fender-ish or like a JTM 45.
</p>
<p>The Gain pot works like a limit for the amount of available gain.  With careful setting of the Volume and Gain pots, you can get the most clean volume possible from the 386.  To do this, set the Volume pot to maximum and slowly turn up the Gain pot.  Find the point just before the sound starts to break up and you have the maximum clean volume available.  To kick things into overdrive, turn up the Gain pot to the desired maximum gain and adjust the Volume pot.  These pots are highly interactive.  If you have the Gain pot set high and you are still not getting desireable overdrive, you'll have to turn up the Volume pot to let more signal pass to the 386.</p>
<p>An MPF102 FET is specified for the buffer, though a 2N5457 will offer similar results.  A J201 will work, but produces a slightly lower output. Also, Ruby was developed using a JRC386D (available from <a href="http://www.smallbearelec.com">Small Bear Electronics</a>), but any 386 can be used, including the type sold at RadioShack.</p><br>
<p><center><b>Possible Modifications</b></center><ul>
<li><b>Bassman</b><br>Replace the .047uF cap from the FET source pin to the volume pot with a 0.1uF.  Place a 220pF cap from lug 3 to lug 2 on the volume pot.  Remove the Gain pot and place 2k2 fixed resistor between pins 1 and 8.  In this configuration, Ruby sounds very much like an old Fender Bassman to our ears.  With the Volume control at half rotation and below, you'll notice smooth and sparkly cleans with good depth.  With the Volume pot set high, you'll hear nice overdrive that is great for blues playing.  The transition from dirty to clean can be controlled with your picking or strumming. This aspect can add an extra dimension to your playing.</li><br>
<li><b>Pre-set Gain Ceiling</b><br>Use a 1k, 2k, or 5k trimmer in place of the Gain pot.  This will allow a pre-set for the amount of gain and distortion over the Volume pot travel.</li><br>
<li><b>12v power</b><br>A 9v power source is indicated on the schematic and layout, but Mark Hammer (<a href="http://hammer.ampage.org">hammer.ampage.org</a>) recommends using 8 AA batteries.  The 12v supplied by the battery pack provides longer battery life and increased headroom.  No circuit modifications are necessary, but be sure that your 386 is rated for 12v.</li><br>
<li><b>Hiwatt</b><br>Ricky Vance (aka RDV) reports that using a 15n input cap and increasing the volume pot value to 50k will produce Pete Townshend tones when driven by a booster.  Also, adding a .001uF treble bleed cap between lugs 3 and 2 of the pot will help retain high-end clarity at lower volumes.  Finally, Ricky left pins 1 and 8 open for added headroom and added the output RC network as used in the <a href="littlegem.html">Little Gem</a>.</li></ul>
